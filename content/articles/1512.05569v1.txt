Abstract

In multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems, ratings are assigned to

the alternatives on diﬀerent criteria by the expert group. In this paper, we

propose a thermodynamically consistent model for MCDM using the analo-

gies for thermodynamical indicators - energy, exergy and entropy. The most

commonly used method for analysing MCDM problem is Technique for Or-

der of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The conventional

TOPSIS method uses a measure similar to that of energy for the ranking of

alternatives. We demonstrate that the ranking of the alternatives is more

meaningful if we use exergy in place of energy. The use of exergy is superior

due to the inclusion of a factor accounting for the quality of the ratings by

the expert group. The unevenness in the ratings by the experts is measured

by entropy. The procedure for the calculation of the thermodynamical indi-

cators is explained in both crisp and fuzzy environment. Finally, two case

studies are carried out to demonstrate eﬀectiveness of the proposed model.

1. Introduction

Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is a process used for ranking of

alternatives based on diﬀerent criteria. The applications of MCDM are nu-

merous and it has been applied to human resource management (Shih et al.,

2007), transportation (Tsaur et al., 2002), portfolio optimization (Ehrgott et al.,

2004), product design (Liu, 2011), vendor selection (Shyur and Shih, 2006)

and visual inspection (Verma et al., 2015). The most commonly used method

for MCDM is Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal So-

lution (TOPSIS). The advantages of TOPSIS includes (Shih et al., 2007) -

scalar value accounting for both best and worst alternative; logical repre-

sentation of human rationale and easy implementation. TOPSIS is based

upon the concept that the chosen solution should be closest to positive ideal

solution and farthest from negative ideal solution.

The motivation for the present study comes from the application of ther-

modynamics in the ﬁeld of bibliometric research by Prathap (2011). The

analogies of the energy, exergy and entropy energy, exergy and entropy as-

sociated with a bibliometric sequence were used to derive an indicator of

a scientists performance. In this paper, we present a model for MCDM in

the paradigm of thermodynamics. We deﬁne analogies for thermodynamical

indicators - energy, exergy and entropy with respect to MCDM. It should

be noted that the entropy deﬁned in the present study is diﬀerent from

Shannon’s entropy (Shannon and Weaver, 1963) which assumes a prior dis-

tribution. A natural deﬁnition of entropy derived from the ﬁrst principles

is used in the present study. It is observed that the conventional TOPSIS

2

method uses a measure similar to what we deﬁne as energy indicator. We

demonstrate with the help of examples that it is exergy indicator which makes

more sense in the ranking of alternative than energy indicator. The proposed

model is quite simple to implement and is thermodynamically consistent. The

proposed model is formulated for both crisp and fuzzy environment. The ef-

fectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with the help of two case

studies (covering both crisp and fuzzy environment).

The organization of the paper is as follows. The second section deﬁnes

the preliminaries towards thermodynamics. In the third section, we deﬁne

analogies for the energy, exergy and entropy in both crisp and fuzzy environ-

ment. The fourth section describes why using exergy indicator makes more

sense than using an indicator based on energy. Fifth section lists out the pro-

cedure for MCDM using thermodynamical indicators. Afterwards, two case

studies are carried out to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the method in

both crisp and fuzzy environment. The ﬁnal section presents the conclusions

drawn from the present study.

2. Preliminaries towards thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is viewed as the science of energy. In this section, we

reproduce the deﬁnition of the terms like energy, exergy and entropy based

on Dincer and Cengel (2001) for the sake of completeness. The section also

describes the two basic laws which govern the science of thermodynamics.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Energy (U) of a system is deﬁned as its ability to do work.

It can neither be created nor be destroyed but can only be converted from

one form to another. It depends on the parameters of the matter or energy

3

ﬂow only and is independent of environment parameters. It is a measure of

quantity alone.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Exergy (X) of a system is the maximum useful work possible

during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with the speciﬁed

reference environment. Exergy is the potential of a system to cause a change

as it achieves equilibrium with its environment. It depends upon parameters

of matter or energy ﬂow and environment. It is a measure of both quantity

and quality.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Entropy (S) of a system is the measurement of the amount

of disorder in the system. A system can generate entropy. The entropy

of the system can be increased or decreased by energy transport across the

system boundary. The direction of the change in the states of the system is

from a state of low probability to the one with higher probability. Since, the

disordered states are more probable than ordered states, the natural direction

of the change in system states is from order to disorder.

First law of thermodynamics

The energy is a thermodynamic property which can change from one form

to another but the total amount of energy remains constant. It is based on

the conservation of energy.

Second law of thermodynamics

The energy has quality as well as quantity, and actual processes occur in the

direction of decreasing quality of energy. Any process either increases the

entropy of the universe - or leaves it unchanged.

The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics gives no information about the direction

4

of the energy conversion or the quality of energy.

It is the second law of

thermodynamics which establishes the diﬀerence in the quality of the various

forms of energy. Based on second law of thermodynamics, entropy can be

seen as the measure of energy which is unavailable for direct conversion to

work. Two systems can have same energy but may not able capable of doing

the same amount of useful work. A system which is capable doing more

useful work is said to have good quality of energy compared to other.

3. Thermodynamical analogies

In this section, we deﬁne analogies for the thermodynamical terms in

both crisp and fuzzy environment. These analogies lay down the basis for

the thermodynamically consistent MCDM model. Let an alternative (A) is

rated by a decision maker (E), for a criterion (C). The weight assigned to

the criterion by the expert is w. The rating and the weights are normalized

between 0 to 1. The rating and the weights are expressed as ﬁxed numbers

(r, w) in case of crisp and triangular fuzzy number (˜r, ˜w) in case of fuzzy en-

vironment. A triangular fuzzy number (˜x) is determined by a triplet (a, b, c)

(Fig. 1) whose membership function is given by:

x − a
b − a
x − c
b − c
0

a ≤ x ≤ b

b ≤ x ≤ c

Otherwise

(1)

µ˜x(x) =




We assume that the fuzzy number associated with the rating ˜r is (ra, rb, rc)

and with the weight ˜w is (wa, wb, wc).

MCDM is deﬁned as the weight assigned to it by an expert. In Fig. 2, the

force/weight associated with alternative A is w.

Deﬁnition 3.2. The potential of an alternative in MCDM is deﬁned as the

rating assigned to it by an expert. In Fig. 2, the potential associated with

alternative A is r.

Deﬁnition 3.3. The potential diﬀerence between two states r1 and r2 of

the system is given by:

d = |r1 − r2|

˜d = (|r1a − r2a|, |r1b − r2b|, |r1c − r2c|)

(2a)

(2b)

Deﬁnition 3.4. Work (W ) done by the system during the change in state

from r1 to r2 is equal to the change in its potential energy. The work done

is given by:

W = w.d(r1, r2)

˜W = ˜w. ˜d( ˜r1, ˜r2)

(3a)

(3b)

Deﬁnition 3.5. Energy indicator (U) of an alternative is deﬁned as the

energy possessed by virtue of its rating in the system. The energy associated

with alternative A in crisp and fuzzy environment is given by:

(4a)

(4b)

U = w.r

˜U = ˜w.˜r

= (wa, wb, wc).(ra, rb, rc)

= (wara, wbrb, wcrc)

7

Deﬁnition 3.6. The quality of a rating is the measure of its degree of

excellence compared to other rating. If all the experts have a consensus in

the rating, then quality is equal to one.

It is measured as one minus the

relative distance of a rating from the mean rating. Let an alternative A be

rated (r1, r2, ..., rn) by n experts and the mean rating is ¯r. The quality of ith

rating is given by:

d(ri, ¯r)

¯r

q = (cid:16)1 −
˜q = (cid:16)(1, 1, 1) −
= (cid:16)1 −

(cid:17)

Deﬁnition 3.7. Exergy indicator of a rating is the measure of the quality

energy that a rating carries. Mathematically, it is given by:

X = q.U

˜X = ˜q. ˜U

(6a)

(6b)

Deﬁnition 3.8. Entropy indicator is a measure of the unevenness in the

ratings of an alternative. If an alternative is assigned exactly same rating

by all the experts, then the entropy is equal to zero. Thus, the entropy of a

rating can be deﬁned as (Prathap, 2011):

S = U − X

˜S = ˜U − ˜X

(7a)

(7b)

4. Energy vs. Exergy

Let us assume that there are K decision makers, rating m alternatives

based on n criteria. In the classical TOPSIS method, the ratings and the

8

weights are ﬁrst aggregated using arithmetic mean or any other suitable

method. The aggregated ratings and weights are then assembled to form

decision (D) and weight (W ) matrix as given below:

D =





x12

· · · x1n

x21
x22
...
...
xm1 xm2

· · ·

· · · x2n
...
· · · xmn





(8)

W = h w1 w2

· · · wn i

where xij denotes the aggregate rating of ith alternative for jth criterion and

wj represents the weight for jth criterion.

In order to bring various criteria on a comparable scale, vector or linear

normalization is carried out. Normalized decision matrix (R) given by:

R =





r11

· · ·

· · ·

r2n
...
· · · rmn





(9)

where rij denotes the normalized rating of ith alternative for jth criterion.

The weighted normalized decision matrix is constructed by multiplying the

weights with the normalized rating and is given by:

V = h vij i ,

where vij = wj(.)rij

i = 1, 2, · · · , m

j = 1, 2, · · · , n

9

(10)

On careful observation, it is found that the term vij is similar to what we have

deﬁned as energy in the previous section. The energy indicator associated

with a rating gives the information only about the quantity and not the

quality. In the process of aggregation of rating, the information on its quality

is lost. There is a need for an indicator which not only accounts for the

quantity but quality as well. Exergy indicator deﬁned in the previous section

includes both the quantity and the quality of the energy. This motivates the

use of exergy indicator in place of energy. In this section, we highlight how

the use of exergy indicator instead of energy makes more sense using two

diﬀerent examples covering both crisp and fuzzy environment.

Example 4.1. Consider a case where two alternatives (A1 and A2) are rated

by 10 decision makers on a particular criterion. The aggregated weight (w)

for the criterion is 0.7. The normalized ratings(r) for A1 are clustered and

varies from 0.4−0.6 with a mean of 0.5. In case of A2, the normalized ratings

are more dispersed (varies from 0.1 − 0.8) but has the same mean as A1 (that

is 0.5). The histogram of the normalized ratings is plotted in Fig. 3 for A1

and in Fig. 4 for A2. The normalized ratings assigned to an alternative and

the calculated thermodynamical indicators are given in Table 1 for A1 and

Table 2 for A2.

It is observed from Tables 1 and 2 that the weighted normalized decision

(which is equivalent to energy indicator) for both the alternatives will lead

to same value of 0.35, if we use classical TOPSIS method. Figures. 3 and 4

clearly suggests that the ratings for A1 are more reliable than for A2. This fact

is also evident from the value of mean quality indicator for A1 and A2. This

information is lost if we use energy indicator. On the other hand, the exergy

indicator clearly suggests that the A1 is better rated than A2. Mean entropy

values of A1 and A2 indicates that the unevenness in the ratings assigned to

an alternative by the decision makers is more in case of A2 compared to A1.

Example 4.2. In this example, the ratings (˜r) are assigned to the alterna-

tives A1 and A2 in the form of triangular fuzzy number by 5 decision makers

on a particular criterion. The weight ( ˜w) assigned to the criteria is a tri-

angular fuzzy number (0.7, 0.8, 0.9). The normalized fuzzy rating assigned

to A1 and A2 are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The numbers in the bracket in

Figs. 5 and 6 represents the decision maker corresponding to that rating.

The normalized fuzzy rating assigned to an alternative and the calculated

thermodynamical fuzzy indicators are given in Table 3 for A1 and in Table 4

for A2. The mean normalized fuzzy rating and the mean fuzzy energy is same

for A1 and A2. In this case also, the classical TOPSIS method will result in

same weighted normalized fuzzy decision even though there is a large diﬀer-

ence in the quality of ratings of A1 and A2. This diﬀerence is reﬂected in the

mean fuzzy exergy indicator.

Based on the examples studied, we conclude that the use of exergy in-

dicator in place of indicator based on energy will bring more rationality to

the decision making process. The use of exergy indicator will enable to ac-

count for the quality of the ratings which is neglected in the classical TOPSIS

method.

5. Evaluation of thermodynamical indicators

A systematic approach is presented in this section for the ranking of

alternatives in MCDM based on exergy indicator in both crisp and fuzzy

environment. The MCDM problem consists of K decision makers rating m

alternatives on n criteria. The detailed step-by-step procedure is described

below:

6. Case studies

In this section, we take up two examples from the literature to demon-

strate the application of the proposed methodology. The ranking based on

the thermodynamical indicators is then compared with ranking reported in

the literature.

Example 6.1. Human resource selection in crisp environment

This problem is adopted from Shih et al. (2007). A company wants to recruit

a manager. There are 17 eligible candidates to be evaluated by 4 decision

makers (DM) on 7 beneﬁt criteria out of which ﬁve are objective and two are

subjective. The objective criteria includes language test (C1), professional

test (C2), safety rule test (C3), professional skills (C4) and computer skills

(C5). The subjective criteria includes panel interview (C6) and one-on-one

interview (C7). The score of the candidates in objective and subjective cri-

teria are given in Table 5. The weights assigned to the diﬀerent criteria are

given in Table 6.

The energy, exergy and entropy indicators are evaluated using the proce-

dure described in the previous section. The alternatives are ranked in terms

of energy and exergy indicators. The ranking obtained from the thermody-

namical indicators is then compared with that reported in Shih et al. (2007).

The values of the calculated thermodynamical indicators and ranking of the

candidates are given in Table 7. The rating which are diﬀerent from what is

reported in the literature are highlighted. It is observed that the energy indi-

cator ranks the alternative almost similar to the ranking based on extended

TOPSIS (Shih et al., 2007). The reason being the terms in the decision ma-

trix of extended TOPSIS are similar to what we deﬁned as energy. The

ranking based on exergy indicator is also close to that of extended TOPSIS

except for A2 and A5. If we carefully look at the subjective rating of A2 and

A5 (highlighted in Table 5), we observe that the variation in the ratings of

A5 is more than A2. For A2, the ratings ranges from 60 to 70 for C6 and

70 to 77 for C7. In case of A5, the rating ranges from 50 to 75 for C6 and

55 to 80 for C7. This is also evident from the entropy values of A2 and A5.

The quality of the rating reduces with the increase in variations. The conﬁ-

dence in the information that we have depends on its quality. This factor is

accounted well if we use exergy indicator.

Example 6.2. Human resource selection in fuzzy environment

This problem is adopted from Chen (2000). A software company wants to

hire system analysis engineer. There are three eligible candidates (A1, A2,

A3) to be evaluated by three decision makers (DM1, DM2, DM3) on ﬁve

beneﬁt criteria - emotional steadiness (C1), oral communication skill (C2),

personality (C3), past experience (C4) and self-conﬁdence (C5). The ratings

and the weights are assigned in terms of linguistic variables. The triangular

fuzzy number corresponding to the linguistic variables for ratings and weights

are given in Table 8. The weights assigned to the diﬀerent criteria are given

in Table 9. The ratings of the three candidates for each of the criteria are

given in Table 10. The values of the thermodynamical indicators and ranking

of the candidates are given in Table 11.

The ranking of the alternative based on energy and exergy indicators is

found to be same as that obtained from fuzzy TOPSIS (Chen, 2000). The

rating of the alternatives are clustered and the variations are less. This

proves that when the variations in the ratings are small, same ranking order

is obtained from TOPSIS, energy and exergy indicators. An exercise is taken

up to highlight the eﬀect of variations on the ranking of candidates based

on diﬀerent methods. The ratings of the candidate A2 by DM1 for criteria

C1 and C2 are changed from (G, VG) to (VP, VP), respectively. The new

thermodynamical indicators and ranking of the candidates are given in Table

12. The variations in the ratings of A2 has resulted in increase in its entropy

indicator. The eﬀect of this variation is accounted only in the ranking based

on exergy indicator.

The two examples demonstrates the eﬀectiveness of the proposed method-

ology in both crisp and fuzzy environments.

7. Conclusions

A new model is proposed for MCDM based on thermodynamical analo-

gies. The deﬁnition of thermodynamical indicators are derived from the ﬁrst

principles. The energy indicator associated with a rating gives an idea of

the quantity of potential energy that a rating carries (based on ﬁrst law of

thermodynamics). The expression of the exergy indicator is derived from the

second law of thermodynamics. The exergy indicator gives information on

the amount of energy which can be converted to useful work. The entropy

indicator gives an idea about the unevenness in the rating of an alternative.

The entropy in the present study is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between energy

and exergy (Prathap, 2011) which is diﬀerent from the Shanon’s deﬁnition

(Shannon and Weaver, 1963). Shanon’s entropy assumes a prior distribution

for the ratings while no such assumption is made in the present study. The

conﬁdence in the ratings reduces if there are large variations in the rating

given by diﬀerent decision makers. The classical TOPSIS method uses what

we deﬁne as energy for the formulation of the decision matrix. The infor-

mation on the quality of rating was neglected. We suggest the use of exergy

indicator in place of energy to eﬀectively account for the quality of the rat-

ings in the decision making process. The new model is simple to implement

and involves less computations compared to TOPSIS. In the proposed model,

the alternatives can be ranked directly based on the value of exergy indica-

tor eliminating the calculation of the separation measures from positive and

negative ideal solution which is required in TOPSIS.
