Dear Colleagues and Stakeholders,

Transforming health care is a formidable challenge that can only be met through a coordinated response from academic and practice leaders from across the health professions. Nursing recognizes its important role in steering this critical work and maintaining a laser focus on what is best for the public.

Advancing Healthcare Transformation: A New Era for Academic Nursing was conceived from a desire to maximize nursing’s contribution to ushering in healthcare reform. Since 2013, AACN member deans from Academic Health Centers (AHCs) have engaged in robust discussions about the evolving role of schools of 
nursing in this unprecedented time of accelerating change. These forward thinking leaders were so passionate about this topic that they issued a call to action to the AACN Board of Directors. The deans formally asked the 
board to conduct a national study to better understand the possibilities and challenges ahead for academic nursing. In February 2015, AACN commissioned a comprehensive study on how to highlight nursing’s role in AHCs. Soon after, Manatt Health was selected to work with us in preparing this report on how to best position nursing schools for long-term success and sustainability.

From the onset of this project, AACN was committed to ensuring that the scope of research would be 
comprehensive, discussions would be interprofessional, and final recommendations would be achievable. To 
commence this work, interviews were conducted with a variety of stakeholders in AHC and non-AHC affiliated 
institutions to uncover the issues and the opportunities facing academic nursing. Findings from the interviews 
were used as discussion points for a national summit of AHC leaders convened by AACN and Manatt in 
Washington, DC in August 2015. Following the summit, two surveys to AHC leaders were issued to better 
determine how academic nursing could make a greater contribution to the larger health enterprise. 

Armed with a fresh understanding of today’s landscape, this report identifies a path for achieving an enhanced 
partnership between academic nursing and academic health centers around the imperative to advance 
integrated systems of health care, achieve improved health outcomes, and foster new models for innovation. 
AACN is confident that lessons learned from this study will be important to the full universe of baccalaureate 
and higher degree nursing programs. The work initiated with those located in AHCs will continue. The dialogue 
has started. Academic nursing must play a significant role in advancing healthcare transformation at the local, 
state, and national levels.

All those connected with this bellwether report, including dozens of academic and practice leaders who 
contributed insights and recommendations, are excited by its potential to magnify nursing’s impact on 
improving health and health care. AACN is looking forward to working with the full community of stakeholders 
to disseminate this report broadly, assess its long-term outcomes, and assist schools as they implement the 
recommendations. We invite you to join us as we move to meet the challenges ahead and reap the rewards that 
come with meaningful change.

Executive Summary

Advancing Healthcare Transformation: A New Era for 
Academic Nursing, commissioned by the American 
Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), provides 
a deeper examination of the potential for enhanced 
partnership between academic nursing and academic 
health centers (AHCs) around the imperative to 
advance integrated systems of health care, achieve 
improved health outcomes, and foster new models for 
innovation. It is intended as a guide for nursing and 
AHC leaders in implementing organizational change 
that will bring the assets and talents of their schools of 
nursing to bear on the challenge of transforming health 
care in their region.

Academic health centers have long been at the apex of 
American health care and pivotal to its vibrancy. Health 
reform imperatives are compelling AHCs to broaden 
their focus to community settings and to deliver care 
across the continuum of patient needs. Coupled 
with changing economics, market consolidation, 
generational changes in the healthcare workforce, and 
an increasing focus on chronic disease prevention and 
management, these market dynamics are requiring 
AHCs to transform their operating models and to 
evolve into more integrated and efficient systems  
of care.

In addition to providing the largest professional 
workforce in the health system, nurses serve a central 
role in the management of AHC’s patients and their 
families. Nurses are often the primary interface point 
and advocate for patients. Patients desire to be 
well—and nurses have a critical role in making health 
care better. As academic health systems develop and 
increasingly implement value-based reimbursement 
programs and assume responsibilities for populations 
of patients, health system leaders should look to 
nurses to lead and support prevention and wellness 
programs, new models of care delivery, continuity 
across transitions in care settings, and integration with 
home and community based services and resources. 
At the same time, academic nursing is advancing 
higher levels of preparation and developing pathways 
for deeper specialization, which can help AHCs expand 
access to care and address the primary care shortages 

2

in many communities. To date, the potential and 
opportunity for academic nursing in the transformation 
of AHCs into health systems has not been considered 
thoroughly.

Summary of Findings

The findings presented in this report regarding the 
current state of alignment of academic nursing with 
AHCs are sobering.

●● Finding 1: Academic nursing is not positioned as 

a partner in healthcare transformation.
Significant organizational limitations prevent 
academic nursing from functioning as a true 
partner in AHC transformation. These include 
minimal meaningful participation in health system 
governance, lack of integration of nursing faculty 
into health system leadership roles, marginal 
integration of nursing faculty into clinical 
services, and siloed nurse-scientist research. 

●● Finding 2: Institutional leaders recognize 

the missed opportunity for alignment with 
academic nursing and are seeking a new 
approach.
Preparation of this report entailed numerous 
interviews, surveys of deans of nursing, university 
presidents, and a summit that convened 
institutional leaders for candid dialogue.  
A theme that ran consistently throughout these 
discussions was one of missed opportunity 
for partnership and a strong desire to reset 
relationships around a dynamic vision for 
academic nursing. 

●● Finding 3: Insufficient resources are a barrier 

to supporting a significantly enhanced role for 
academic nursing. 
The tuition-dependent funding structure of 
academic nursing severely limits the ability of 
schools of nursing to participate in healthcare 
transformation initiatives and to provide the 
institutional leadership of which they are capable. 
Most schools of nursing do not have faculty 
practices and therefore no clinical income, nor 
do they generally receive funding from their 

affiliated health systems. Despite unique research 
capacity (in particular, related to patient-oriented 
research), schools of nursing received $133 
million (1%) in NIH funding from an approximately 
$30 billion total budget. 

Summary of 
Recommendations

An enhanced partnership between AHCs and 
academic nursing will benefit all parties and, 
above all, enhance the ability of academic health 
systems to transform health care. Achieving a new 
partnership requires that nursing faculty have a deeper 
involvement in clinical practice and greater opportunity 
to engage in the clinical innovation needed by evolving 
academic health systems. Stronger partnerships 
also entail fostering enhanced nurse-scientist based 
patient and community-oriented research. This report, 
therefore, recommends six actions for  
institutional leaders:

1.  Embrace a New Vision  

for Academic Nursing 

The report recommends that institutions adopt the 
following vision: Academic nursing is a full partner 
in healthcare delivery, education, and research 
that is integrated and funded across all professions 
and missions in the Academic Health System. The 
elements of this vision include:

 ▪ Nursing participation in health system governance
 ▪ Expanded academic nursing leadership in clinical 

practice and care delivery

 ▪ Growth and evolution of academic nursing 

research programs in partnership with the medical 
school, health system, and other professional 
schools

 ▪ Collaborative workforce plans and training 

programs in partnership with the health system
Integration of academic nursing into population 
health initiatives

 ▪

 ▪ System-wide commitment to leadership 

development to prepare and support future  
nurse leaders

2.  Enhance the Clinical Practice of 

Academic Nursing 

Initiatives should be implemented that more fully bring 
nursing faculty into the clinical practice of the health 
system and connect the clinical service more closely to 
the academic mission of the school of nursing.

3.  Partner in Preparing the Nurses  

of the Future

Build a pipeline of nurses at multiple levels (BSN, MSN, 
DNP, PhD) so as to meet the clinical requirements of 
the extended AHC system. Create nursing leadership 
development programs for faculty and practicing 
nurses that are jointly managed by the school of 
nursing and clinical practice. 

4.  Partner in the Implementation  

of Accountable Care

Strategies include joint clinical planning, having 
academic nursing provide leadership in developing 
linkages between acute care and post-acute, home-
based and long- term care services, and expanding 
nurse-led community programs under the leadership 
of academic nursing faculty in partnership with health 
system leaders and clinicians.

5.  Invest in Nursing Research Programs 

and Better Integrate Research into 
Clinical Practice 

A true, research-grounded and evidence-based 
nursing service will enrich the life of the AHC and 
benefit the community. Strategies include creating 
mechanisms to coordinate research projects and 
activities across academic nursing and AHCs; 
developing joint research programs between academic 
nursing and health system nurse-scientists; integrating 
nurse researchers into developing informatics 
programs; strengthening the training programs for 
nurse clinical trial coordinators and clinical research 
nurses; providing leadership in establishing linkages 
to other professional schools; and expanding nursing 
faculty development and recruitment to include PhD 
investigators across multiple disciplines in targeted 
research areas.

6.  Implement an advocacy  

agenda in support of a new era  
for academic nursing 

This recommendation is directed toward AACN, 
institutional leaders, and kindred associations 
interested in and committed to the alignment and 
integration of nursing more broadly with the goals of 
the Triple Aim. Planks of the recommended agenda 
include: seeking growth in NIH budget to support 
nursing-led research, especially at NINR; increased 
funding support for the training of nurse-scientists; 
advancing a national nursing agenda that links to the 
Triple Aim, including expansion of the Graduate Nurse 
Education (GNE) Demonstration; heightened advocacy 
for scope of practice changes to enable nurses to take 
on the clinical roles they are trained to perform; and 
support for academic nursing leadership in clinical  
care delivery. 

Achieving the potential for academic nursing as 
described in this report requires a change in culture 
that can only be accomplished by the collaborative 
leadership of university presidents, deans of nursing 
and medicine, and health system chief executives. 
All parties must embrace a new vision for academic 
nursing, and by doing so deal directly with the cultural 
and structural issues that are impeding the flowering of 
potential that indeed all perceive. Leaders committed 
to a new vision for academic nursing will challenge 
the status quo and seek to unharness the potential 
of their nursing colleagues. Participatory governance 
structures that cross-populate, as appropriate, 
leaders of the academic and clinical practices will 
help to ensure mission integration and proper insights 
from a diverse set of constituencies. Participatory 
governance will be immeasurably enhanced by 
collaborative strategic and financial decision making 
around academic and clinical programs, workforce 
development, and research programs. Further 
alignment of medicine, nursing, and health system 
organizations may also prove beneficial for certain 
institutions.

A New Era  
for Academic Nursing

In 2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 
Committee on the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 
Initiative on the Future of Nursing released the 
seminal report, The Future of Nursing: Leading 
Change, Advancing Health,’ which articulated the 
critical role the nursing profession plays in the delivery 
of health care and the imperative for nursing to 
provide significant leadership in the transformation 
of healthcare delivery in the U.S. The culmination 
of a two-year initiative, the report examined the 
opportunities and the barriers for the over 3 million 
members of the nursing profession—the largest 
segment of our nation’s healthcare workforce—to 
be able to respond effectively to rapidly changing 
healthcare settings and an evolving health care system 
as change leaders in advancing health. The IOM report 
delivered four action-oriented messages as a blueprint 
for the future of nursing:

1.  Nurses should practice to the full extent of their 

education and training.

2.  Nurses should achieve higher levels of 

education and training through an improved 
education system that promotes seamless 
academic progression.

3.  Nurses should be full partners, with physicians 
and other professionals, in redesigning health 
care in the United States.

4.  Effective workforce planning and policy making 
require better data collection and an improved 
information infrastructure.

This report, commissioned by the American 
Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), provides 
a deeper examination of the potential for enhanced 
partnership between academic nursing and academic 
health centers (AHCs) around the imperative to 
advance integrated systems of health care, achieve 
improved health outcomes, and foster new models 
of financial sustainability for the tripartite academic 
mission of clinical care delivery, research, and 

6

education. It is intended as a guide for university 
and AHC leaders in planning for and implementing 
organizational change that will bring the assets and 
talents of academic nursing to bear in the challenge of 
transforming health care in their region.

Nurses are on the frontlines of care delivery. Nurses 
practice in a wide variety of settings, including the 
hospital, the clinic, the classroom, community health 
settings, the business sector, home health care, and 
the laboratory but in all cases, the primary goal of 
the nursing professional is to advocate for the patient 
and to provide optimal care based on evidence-
based guidelines. As the nation’s largest professional 
healthcare workforce, registered nurses are not only 
vital members of the patient care team and often the 
patient’s and/or family’s primary interface with the 
healthcare system, they also are critical partners for 
physicians and health system leaders in advancing 
patient-centered care models, improving access to 
primary and preventative care, and achieving success 
in new payment models centered around quality  
and value.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 
2010 (ACA) has served as a catalyst for the shift to 
value-based reimbursement on the part of the federal 
government (the nation’s largest healthcare payer) 
and commercial insurers. In order to succeed in a 
value-based model, where providers are rewarded for 
increased efficiency, improved health outcomes and 
prevention and management of chronic conditions 
before they require hospitalization, the U.S. healthcare 
delivery model must transform to one that fosters 
more effective systems of high quality care that are 
oriented around the needs of the patient. The IOM 
recommended in Crossing the Quality Chasm: A 
New Health System for the 21st Century (2001)ii that 
healthcare providers adopt patient-centered care 
models, which the IOM defined as providing care that 
is respectful of and responsive to individual patient 
preferences, needs and values, and ensuring that 
patient values guide all clinical decisions.

Academic nursing and the nurses they educate 
are essential to this healthcare transformation. The 
healthcare workforce faces significant provider

shortages—including of nurses—at the same time 
that approximately one quarter of the U.S. population 
is passing the retirement age and projected to 
impose increased demand for access to healthcare 
services, particularly chronic disease management.2 
As healthcare systems pursue population health 
approaches and seek to provide care in lower cost 
outpatient settings, there is an increasing demand 
for nurses to fill this need. Academic nursing is the 
vehicle for preparing these needed nurses—including 
baccalaureate and graduate degree prepared nurses 
and PhD-prepared nurse-scientists—who operate in 
every clinical care setting from primary care offices 
to specialty clinics to inpatient settings to hospice 
and home.

Academic nursing also is developing new education 
models designed to prepare nurses for future 
healthcare delivery within a population health 

orientation. Interprofessional education, where nurses, 
physicians, and other clinicians learn and train together 
in a collaborative environment to improve health 
outcomes is becoming more widely adopted and 
becoming more prevalent in curricula. Nurses are often 
leaders in the development of these programs.

Further, academic nursing is involved in pioneering 
research focused on population health, chronic 
disease management models, and collaborative care 
approaches translated into new care models that 
improve the health of patients and the population.

Yet despite its potentially integral role within AHCs, 
academic nursing has largely operated with only a 
minimal level of alignment with the health system 
and/or their peers in academic medicine. While 
academic medicine tends to be tightly integrated in 
health system decision-making, it is the exception for 
academic nursing to be similarly involved. In certain

65 or older will climb to more than 71 million, up from about 41 million in 2011, a 73 percent increase, according to Census Bureau estimates.  
Patients over 65 years of age typically have more than one chronic healthcare condition.  The American Hospital Association projects that more 
than 37 million boomers will be managing more than one chronic condition by 2030.

cases this is an artifact of the reporting relationships 
of the professional schools, with medicine and the 
health system having grown over time into a unified 
organization and academic nursing remaining in a 
separate professional silo, resulting in barriers to 
collaboration. The development of clinical leadership 
roles such as the chief nursing officer (CNO) has 
provided a stronger voice for nursing in decision-
making in the health system; however, in most cases, 
there remains a lack of alignment between academic 
nursing and the broader health system as well as AHC 
governance and management.

A particularly acute challenge being faced by many 
AHCs is the disruption of their traditional specialty 
services-focused business model by the shift towards 
value-based payment and the formation of mega-
systems of care and “narrow network” insurance 
offerings, which increasingly limit specialty referrals. 
This report asserts that academic nursing can serve 
a vital function for health systems attempting to 
become expert in population health and thus diversify 
from their specialty care roots. This potential is due 
to nursing having the interest and the expertise 
related to critical components of population health—
including the provision of primary and preventive 
care, community engagement, deployment of multi-
disciplinary and interprofessional care teams, the 
training of advanced practice registered nurses, 
understanding the impact and intervention points 
related to social determinants of health, management 
of care across the continuum of care, and patient and 
family/caregiver engagement. 

This report first considers the present state of 
alignment between academic nursing and AHCs, 
describing three major issues that will shape the 
path forward for an enhanced partnership. We 
then describe a future vision for academic nursing 
and a framework for implementation intended to 
guide leaders in the formation of a new partnership. 
Throughout, we highlight examples of innovative 
and successful initiatives. Lastly, we provide 
recommendations for university presidents, nursing 
and medical school deans, and chief executives of 
health systems. These leaders—deans of medicine

and health system leaders in particular—are critical 
to the success of the recommendations contained in 
this report, and the report seeks to provide guidance 
for them in beginning to align more closely with their 
partner schools of nursing.

The State of Alignment 
of Academic Nursing 
within Academic  
Health Centers 

In the preparation of this report, Manatt Health 
conducted 48 interviews at 25 institutions. Interviews 
were conducted with 25 nursing school deans, 5 
medical school deans, 16 health system CNOs and 
CEOs, and 8 university chancellors / vice chancellors.3

During these interviews, the project team sought 
to understand the perspective of a diverse set of 
academic and clinical leaders on how the evolving 
AHC intersects with academic nursing, and how 
different points of integration can be better leveraged. 

The interviews addressed the following areas:

 ▪ Vision for academic nursing;
 ▪ Major points of integration with the health system 

(governance, management, strategic, financial, 
mission);

 ▪ Level of alignment between academic nursing and 

the nursing clinical practice in the health system, 
including the role and responsibilities of the dean 
of nursing and nursing faculty;

 ▪ Primary challenges in advancing the shared goals 

of the school of nursing and health system and 
potential points of intersection;

 ▪ Academic nursing financial issues, particularly 
those related to research and education and 
inter-entity (between academic nursing and health 
system) issues. 

In addition to interviews, two surveys were completed 
during December 2015 to collect additional data from 

102 leading academic institutions and academic health 
systems. One survey was completed by nursing deans 
and a second by university presidents and chancellors.4 

In the section that follows, three major findings are 
presented that are based in large measure on these 
interviews, and the two leadership surveys. Additional 
highlights from the interviews and the surveys are 
included throughout.

REPORT FINDINGS

●● Finding 1: Academic nursing is not positioned  

as a partner in healthcare transformation
Significant organizational limitations prevent 
academic nursing from functioning as a true 
partner in AHC transformation, and as a 
result, in many institutions it is largely confined 
to a marginal role. Manifestations of these 
organizational limitations include:

1)  Governance Structures. It is widely known and 
discussed that nurses are not well represented 
on hospital boards—despite their importance in 
the clinical workforce and their trusted role with 
patients. According to a 2010 survey from the 
American Hospital Association, only 6% of hospital 
boards have nurses represented compared to 20% 
with physicians.iii A national study of University 
HealthSystem Consortium hospital members 
suggested that “high-performing boards were 
more likely to have nurses as voting members” 
than were low-performers.iv In the survey of 
nursing deans, most health systems were reported 
as not being inclusive of either the dean of nursing 
or an associate dean on their governing boards, 
and overall, nearly half of respondents indicated 
no nursing participation on the health system 
board at all.

Current nursing participation on health system 
boards contrasts sharply with the views of many of 
the university presidents we surveyed, with 73% 
of respondents strongly or most strongly agreeing 
that schools of nursing should have representation 
on health system boards.

2)  Organization Structures. The differing 
reporting structures that pertain in most 
universities for nursing, medicine, and in some 
cases the health system can become a barrier 
to the enhanced partnership and collaboration 
described in this report. In many universities, 
the faculty professional services and the health 
system increasingly are in close alignment as a 
clinical enterprise. It is rare to find the school 
of nursing being included in these evolving 
structures, some of which are more formal 
and include new governance and reporting 

structures, and others that are focused on 
the integration of operational and financial 
processes. In a few instances all the health 
sciences and the health system have unified 
governance and/or reporting structure, and this 
can facilitate the collaboration across disciplines 
that is increasingly valued.

3) Leadership Structures. Based on our 
interviews and understanding of AHC 
organizational structures, most nursing deans 
and faculty do not hold significant health system 
leadership positions, either as members of the 
health system executive team or as leaders of the 
clinical nursing enterprise. This finding contrasts 
sharply with academic medicine, where the 
dean is often a key member of the health system 
executive team. While there are many variants 
of reporting structures amongst AHC’s, it has

become widely accepted that the Dean and the 
CEO must work intimately and closely together, 
with highly aligned organization structures 
amongst schools of medicine and health 
systems rapidly becoming the norm.v 

Clinical department chairs often lead the 
clinical services of the health system, holding 
appointments in both the school of medicine 
and the health system.

From the survey of nursing deans, many 
reported that they or a member of their 
leadership team hold appointments in the 
health system and the health system CNO 
holds an appointment in the school, however, 
in many cases it was reported that these 
cross-institution appointments lack the 
strength and level of responsibility needed 
to foster innovation and a higher degree of 
collaboration.

Perceived limitations exist within the academic 
nursing community with respect to the 
incorporation of the perspectives of schools of 

University presidents largely 
support a closer strategic 
relationship between 
schools of nursing and their 
partner health systems and 
medical schools, with 89% 
endorsing a school of nursing 
role in the development of 
university strategic plans, 79% 
endorsing a role in health 
system strategic plans, and 
49% endorsing a role in the 
school of medicine’s strategic 
plans. Of the university 
president respondents, 88% 
strongly or most strongly hold the expectation that 
their “school of nursing should be an innovator and 
major contributor to the transformation of health 
care in our region”, reinforcing the expectation that 
their schools of nursing should serve an enhanced 
institutional role.

4)  Integration of Nursing Faculty into the 
Health System. Although nurse training 
programs originated within hospitals in the late 
19th century—the “Nightingale schools”—today 
there is relatively modest clinical integration 
between academic nursing and their affiliated 
health systems. As one measure, a majority of 
nursing deans reported low/minimal integration 
of school of nursing faculty into the clinical 
practice of the health system in the survey of 
nursing deans.

Few nursing clinical faculty members practice 
in their partner health systems. Many deans of 
nursing report difficulty securing appointments 
for clinical faculty, and in many cases, faculty

been minimal. In our view, 
this is largely due to a lack of 
funding for this role.

5) Integration and 
Collaboration in Nurse-
Scientist Research. Nurse-
led research is carried out 
daily both within academic 
nursing and also in the 
health system by faculty and 
non-faculty nurse scientists. 
In many instances, these 
research activities and projects 
operate independently of their 
associated school of nursing, 
despite opportunities for 
collaboration. Barriers also exist 
between academic nursing and 
the health system to facilitate 
nurse-led projects across 
institutions, which inhibits 
potentially innovative research 
projects. Further integration 
and collaboration is needed 
across the different health 
sciences schools. 

must seek clinical placements outside of their 
partner health system to maintain certification. 

This lack of clinical integration has several effects:

 ▪ School of nursing faculty are not viewed as 
full partners by the clinical practice and its 
leadership;

 ▪ Preceptorships and teaching roles for nursing 
students and residents are often filled by non-
faculty nurse leaders from the health system;

 ▪ A limited integration of faculty-led and 

student-led research projects that can lead to 
a stronger “culture of learning;”

 ▪ Academic nursing participation in the 

development of clinical and research strategic 
plans remains minimal.

The appetite in academic nursing for maintaining 
a robust clinical faculty that spends significant 
portions of their time in patient care also has 

12

Overall according to the survey of nursing 
deans, low levels of research collaboration were 
reported between schools of nursing and partner 
health systems, medical schools, and other 
professional schools

Transdisciplinary research programs can and 
should be supported to integrate investigators 
and foster “university-wide” research leadership 
and programs. University president respondents 
strongly supported the notion that nursing 
research programs should be developed and 
better integrated across multiple dimensions 
– in particular within the critically important 
domain of population health science research. 
Over three-quarters of university president 
respondents ranked growing academic programs 
as a high or highest priority, particularly with 
respect to population health science.

●● Finding 2: Institutional leaders recognize 

the missed opportunity from alignment with 
academic nursing and are seeking a new 
approach.
Themes that ran consistently throughout the 
interviews conducted were missed opportunity 
for partnership; frustration at the lack of 
alignment amongst academic nursing, medicine, 
and the health system; and a strong desire to 
reset relationships around a dynamic vision for 
academic nursing. 

 ▪ Deans of nursing report that they often 

are omitted from AHC decision-making and 
efforts to advance important AHC clinical 
redesign, despite attempts at integration 
and offering what they perceive as significant 
value in areas including transitions of 
care, chronic care management, design of 
informatics projects, patient engagement, 
and primary care. Despite notable advances 
in nursing-led research, they report a sense 
of being on the margin of enterprise research 
initiatives focused on population health. 
Deans of nursing believe that they – through 

their faculty, students, and 
academic programs – have 
much to contribute to the 
future success of AHCs and 
that they historically have 
been undervalued at best, 
and ignored at worst. 
▪  The health system

chief executives and 
chief nursing officers 
interviewed recognize 
that academic nursing 
generally has not 
been involved in major 
leadership roles and are 
not often involved in 
health system strategic 
initiatives. Several 
interviewees remarked 
that their affiliated school  
of nursing seemed more 
interested in education 
  and research portfolios than clinical practice. 

We also heard the comment that nursing faculty 
are insufficiently engaged in the clinical delivery 
processes to practically contribute what they 
will readily agree are valuable insights. There 
also was a concern that nursing faculty are 
insufficiently focused on the issue of total cost 
management, and that proposed solutions 
for care coordination and transitions which 
enhance the role of nursing may increase 
costs as an unintended consequence. On the 
other hand, we were advised of “the critical 
importance of academic nursing to achieving 
a patient-centered approach to clinical care,” 
as well as the critical need for the school of 
nursing to graduate nurses prepared to care 
for patients in a 21st century context. Several of 
the interviewees also indicated that academic 
nursing “needs a seat at the table” of health 
system management and were interested in the 
potential for leadership training programs to 
prepare nurse faculty for this responsibility.

●● Finding 3: Insufficient resources are a barrier 

to supporting a significantly enhanced role for 
academic nursing
All the deans of nursing interviewed for this 
report brought up the challenge they face in 
realizing higher aspirations given their current 
funding model, which is highly dependent 
on tuition. They perceive a major disconnect 
between the expectations for an increasingly 
participatory role in AHCs, expanded to all 

missions, with a funding model 
based primarily on the educational 
mission. 

Academic nursing is largely 
funded by tuition dollars and does 
not benefit significantly either 
from funds that flow from their 
affiliated health systems or from 
robust grant support from federal 
agencies. Deans of nursing report 
that, on average, over 60% of their 
funding is from tuition, and trace 
amounts are from clinical income 
and AHC support. Given that total 
budgets reported ranged from $5

Research programs in 
particular should be noted as 
significantly under-resourced 
in academic nursing. The 
dedicated arm of the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) 
institute that funds nursing 
research directly—the 
National Institute for Nursing 
Research (NINR)—constituted 
just 0.4% of the total NIH 
budget of $30 billion in 2015.
vi While it is true that many of 
the other NIH Institutes also 
fund academic nursing, these 
funding amounts are quite 
limited. Academic nursing 
received just over $133 million 
in total NIH funding in 2014, 
compared to significant 
amounts awarded to their 
colleagues in academic 
medicine ($11.4 billion), 
public health ($821 million), 
pharmacy ($252 million), dentistry ($179 million), 
and veterinary medicine ($158 million).vii

Furthermore, of the total 9,000-plus NIH funded

in nursing science.viii However, the paucity of 
nurse-scientists is not solely a result of limited 
funding but also represents the traditional focus of 
academic nursing on training clinical practitioners. 

to $30 million, one can appreciate the limited 
flexibility that the deans have for investment. 

Academic nursing for the most part does not 
have its own clinical income (on average, school 
of nursing budgets in our survey only contained 
4% in clinical support), such as with a “dean’s 
tax”5 comparable to those that often exist in 
medical schools.

For those institutions that do receive financial 
support from their partner health systems, deans

provide academic support funds for the school.  In effect, a cross-subsidization for supporting the school’s missions.

ACADEMIC NURSING LEADERSHIP SUMMIT
On August 25, 2015, AACN hosted a leadership summit 
with deans from academic nursing and medicine, 
university leaders, health system CEOs and CNOs, 
AACN and Association of American Medical Colleges 
leaders, and nursing leadership from the Veterans Health 
Administration.6 The objective of the summit was to 
engage a thorough discussion on health reform, the need 
for academic nursing leadership, and the intersection 
with academic health system transformation.

Manatt Health facilitated this gathering of invited 
leaders and prepared the following summary of the 
major takeaways.

1.  The traditional ways of doing business 
within AHCs must evolve, which will 
necessitate significant culture change across 
all three missions. Of particular importance 
will be enhanced communication, a focus on 
“we,” and a commitment to mutual support. 
Participants recognized that this change in 
culture will be difficult, given that schools of 
nursing, other professional schools, health 
systems, and schools of medicine have become 
increasingly siloed from each other.

2.  New organizational structures that more 
closely couple academic nursing with health 
systems will be important to facilitate 
the kind of successful integration that is a 
precursor to effective collaboration. There 
is no one “correct” structure, but rather, the 
broad principle of alignment of interests along 
strategic, cultural, programmatic, economic, 
and governance dimensions should be pursued. 
Partnership needs to mean: “If I succeed, you 
succeed, and if you fail, I fail.”

3. The financial model of tuition driving 
academic nursing inhibits the strategic and 
aspirational role participants believe is 
possible. Nursing faculty typically focus first 
and foremost on teaching. To some degree this 
accounts for the reluctance of nursing faculty 
to take on positions of clinical responsibility, 
particularly without a financial support model 
for doing so. If academic nursing is to serve 
a transformative role, then the economic 
model must be put in place that provides the 
resources—through clinical, research, and 
educational support—to do so.

4. Within academic nursing there is a strong 
perception that physicians are overly dominant 
and that independence is necessary for nurses 
to achieve their true potential. Contemplating 
the pivotal role for nursing in the future, the 
issues of cultural, organizational, discipline, and 
gender bias that persist in our organizations 
must be addressed, fostering partnership and 
alignment across the professional schools and 
the AHC.

5.  Nursing needs to be at the table as AHCs 
develop their population-health strategies 
and accountable care organizations. Many 
health systems are lacking data scientists and 
implementation scientists. Leaders should be 
seeking new opportunities to connect the dean 
of nursing to other initiatives in their enterprise.

6.  Leadership development is a key long-
term success factor for AHCs given trends in 
interprofessional, team-based clinical care, 
and in multi-professional research programs 
that seek to translate discovery and innovation 
into practice. Approaches that identify and 
foster the development of future leaders— 
both through informal mentorship and formal 
programs to equip future leaders with skills 
needed for leadership—in the clinical, research, 
and administrative realms are essential.

7.  Workforce planning efforts within AHCs 
through partnerships with the health system 
and its affiliated schools represent a major 
opportunity for collaboration:

a. Significant opportunity exists within AHCs 
to link clinical enterprise workforce needs and 
planning to the various academic programs to 
create a robust pipeline of clinicians prepared 
for the future of care delivery. Most institutions 
have failed to realize the power of a true 
partnership around training and workforce 
development.
b. There is a shortage of clinicians to support 
clinical trials and data integrity/analytics roles 
in AHCs, as well as shortages of researchers 
in data science and implementation science. 

Solutions will require collaboration among all 
the disciplines and the health system.

8. Research program capacity-building within 
academic nursing present an important 
opportunity for alignment. Academic nursing 
should consider recruiting PhD investigators 
in emerging areas including informatics, 
implementation science, health services research, 
and patient safety/quality, which can increase the 
number of grant dollars.

9.  The recommendations set forth are 
not without risks to those schools of 
nursing that operate in silos—strategically, 
programmatically, and financially. With 
integration, shared leadership and shared 
governance comes shared accountability for 
success and failure.

10. Policy issues at the federal and state level, 
and possibly within professional societies that 
oversee the various stakeholder groups are 
limiting. Specifically we need to consider:

a. Scope of practice
b. Reimbursement for advanced practice 
registered nurse (APRN) professional services
c. NIH and other public programs to support 
nursing-focused and multi-professional research

Building a Strong 
Partnership

The findings from the interviews, the surveys, and the 
leadership summit are unambiguous: an enhanced 
partnership with academic nursing will benefit all 
parties. On the one hand, AHCs are in the midst of 
significant transformation in clinical care delivery 
and in the evolution and integration of research and 
education programs. Academic nursing can contribute 
materially to the success of this transformation. On the 
other hand, academic nursing has unrealized potential 
to grow as centers for research and clinical innovation 
as the role of nurses expands and develops in health 
care, positively contributing to the ultimate goal of 
advancing health. 

17

To achieve a new partnership the following challenges 
must be met:

 ▪ Academic nursing faculty must have a deeper 

involvement in clinical practice and more 
opportunity to engage in the clinical innovation

needed by evolving academic health systems—
which has significant implications for both 
schools of nursing and AHCs.

 ▪ Research programs across academic nursing, 

health systems, academic medicine, and 
other professional schools must be fostered, 
particularly around patient and community-
oriented research.

Overcoming these challenges will require a paradigm 
shift in how academic and clinical programs across 
health science schools and the clinical enterprise 
organize and align themselves. Academic nursing 
needs to reflect on its aspirations and reorient to these 
themes, and a business case for investment in the 
evolution of academic nursing must be compellingly 
made both nationally and within each institution. 

Most, if not all, AHCs are focused on regional system 
development that will enable them to deliver the 
scope of services necessary to compete with their 
community-system competitors and better manage 
the total cost of care. They are seeking to redesign 
their services and offerings and move away from 
operating exclusively as “destination-centers” for 

tertiary and quaternary care to systems-of-care that 
offer a full range of services along the continuum 
through a combination of owned assets and aligned 
partners. These imperatives intersect with the interests 
of academic nursing leaders, suggesting significant 
potential for an enhanced partnership.

The following six recommendations are designed to 
assist institutional leaders as they consider how best to 
achieve the promise and potential of a full partnership 
with academic nursing. The sections that follow 
provide detail on each of these recommendations, as 
well as highlight exemplar activity from institutions 
across the country where academic and clinical leaders 
have been successful in aligning and integrating 
academic nursing in a true “transformation agenda.”

RECOMMENDATION 1: EMBRACE A NEW 
VISION FOR ACADEMIC NURSING
AHCs are traditionally organized within the context 
of the relationship between academic medicine and 
the health system, with academic nursing playing a 
secondary role in clinical decision making and strategic 
planning for long-term sustainability.

Though significant gains have been achieved by 
nursing since the publication of the IOM Future of 
Nursing report in 2010, real support now needs to 
be put behind engaging the nursing enterprise in 
a number of transformative practices and concepts 
gaining traction within AHCs, including team practice, 
evidence-based health care, population health, and 
patient engagement.

To achieve a new model of interprofessional 
engagement within AHCs, institutional leaders must 
embrace a new vision for academic nursing. Nursing 
is integral to the success of the health system, and 
the impact of a well-positioned school of nursing will 

bring material benefits to the larger enterprise. These 
can include, among others: achieving and sustaining 
magnet designation status; successfully meeting 
the requirements for accountable care organization 
(ACO) programs; broadening the foundation of 
primary care; preparing the clinical workforce for 
the future; realizing clinical and financial benefits 
from value-based payment; transitioning to patient-
centered care; and leading in clinical informatics and 
patient-oriented research. A recommended starting 
point for the future of academic nursing is found 
in the following vision statement, which we urge all 
institutional leaders to embrace:

ACADEMIC NURSING IS A FULL PARTNER IN HEALTHCARE DELIVERY, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH 
THAT IS INTEGRATED AND FUNDED ACROSS ALL PROFESSIONS AND MISSIONS IN THE ACADEMIC 

HEALTH SYSTEM. ELEMENTS OF THIS VISION INCLUDE:

 ▪ Nursing participation in health system governance
 ▪ Expanded academic nursing leadership in clinical practice and care delivery
 ▪ Growth and evolution of academic nursing research programs in partnership with academic medicine, 

the health system, and other professional schools

 ▪ Collaborative workforce plans and training programs in partnership with the health system
 ▪
 ▪ System-wide commitment to leadership development to prepare and support future nurse leaders

Integration of academic nursing into population health initiatives

RECOMMENDATION 2:  
ENHANCE THE CLINICAL PRACTICE OF 
ACADEMIC NURSING 
We recommend that academic nursing and their 
partner AHCs develop mechanisms to more fully 
bring nursing faculty into the clinical practice of the 
health system and seek to connect the  
clinical service more closely to the mission of 
academic nursing.

Nursing, in partnership with the Hospital of the 

University of Pennsylvania (HUP), established two 
roles aimed at facilitating greater linkages between 
the activities of the clinical practice and the school 
of nursing faculty. First, a Clinician Educator (CE) 
role has been developed. CEs are full-time faculty 
members appointed with responsibility for delivery 
of services within the practice setting, based on the 
premise that practice, research, and education are 
interrelated and should be integrated. The health 
system has agreed to fund part of the CE salary 
based on the percentage of clinical time provided 
(variable). In addition to clinical responsibilities, CEs 
have research programs that are often carried out in 
the health system in partnership with other faculty, 
students, and non-faculty nurses. Promotion and 

20

tenure requirements are as vigorous as non-CE 
faculty within the school.  

Second, an Associate Dean for Practice and 
Community role has been developed jointly between 
the Dean of Nursing and the Chief Nursing Officer at 
HUP. The position was designed to support clinical 
research development and the strengthening of 
collaboration between the school and the health 
system. The position is jointly funded and reports 
both to the Dean of Nursing and the CNO of HUP.

Strategies that academic nursing and AHC 
leadership should consider in adopting this 
recommendation include:

1. Establish clinical leadership positions to link 
academic nursing faculty to clinical practice 
leadership and vice-versa. A recommendation 
from several health system executives interviewed 
for this report is for nursing faculty to take on 
greater responsibility for direct clinical care. 
This recommendation is made in the spirit 
of enhancing the ability of nursing faculty to 
provide clinical leadership, in a model akin to 
how physician chiefs of division serve as leaders 
in AHCs. With regard to nursing, as an example, 
a director of critical care nursing might also have 
an academic nursing faculty appointment. Having 
nursing faculty in clinical roles also will benefit 
the education of nurses in the clinical setting, 
with more of an integrated approach between 
faculty and hospital-employed preceptors. 
Deans of nursing and health system CEOs must 
develop appropriate financing models that 
recognize potential contributions to health system 
operations and innovation in clinical care.

UNIVERSITY OF 
ROCHESTER
The University of 
Rochester/University 
of Rochester Medical Center has developed 
an integrated leadership structure to facilitate 
integration of the School of Nursing faculty and 
leaders into the activities of the broader AHC, and 

leverage where possible the leadership of School of 
Nursing faculty in strategic and operational decision-
making. The Dean is a Vice President of the Medical 
Center, sitting at the senior leadership table with the 
Dean/CEO, COO, Hospital CEO, and CMO of the 
faculty practice. The Dean also sits on the Medical 
Center Executive Team and the Nursing Practice 
Executive Council.  This structure allows for the 
collaborative thinking, planning, developing, and 
evaluating of initiatives that support and enhance 
the functioning of the AHC. The participation of the 
school of nursing on this senior team broadens the 
sphere of influence that our faculty/school can have 
in high level discussions and decisions. For example, 
the SON is highly visible in the URMC Strategic Plan—
highlighting the school’s contributions to creating a 
highly educated, diverse workforce and in increasing 
the capacity of the institution’s primary care agenda.

2. Facilitate joint clinical program development 
between academic nursing faculty and clinical 
practice leaders, with particular emphasis on 
ambulatory care and population health. In 
effect, such an effort will facilitate a more robust 
approach to designing and improving clinical 
service delivery in support of the transition to new 
models of care. Development of a joint committee 
or inclusion of academic nursing faculty into 
existing clinical service committees should be 
considered as a mechanism to support broader 
engagement related to care redesign.
3. Grow academic nursing clinical practice as a 
means of meeting several goals described in this 
report: broadening the involvement of nursing 
faculty in clinical care; creating a practice home 
for APRNs; and generating clinical income support 
for the school of nursing. Nursing clinical practice 
is likely to expand in the years ahead as APRNs 
increase in number and scope of practice laws 
continue to evolve to recognize the advancement 
of the profession and its centrality for patient 
care. Therefore, institutions should anticipate 
and plan for expanded nursing clinical practice. 
Broadly, there are two paths for schools of 
nursing to follow, depending on their institutional 
context. One path includes the development 

21

of a nursing faculty practice organization. This 
organization may contract for billing and/or 
management services from the medical faculty 
practice or health system. Organizations that 
have successfully taken this path in some form 
include University of Utah, University of Texas 
Health Science Center at San Antonio, and 
Columbia University School of Nursing. Another 
path is to build a nurse faculty division integrated 
with the medical faculty plan and/or the health 
system employed practice, using a “lease” 
mechanism for the provision of clinical time.

RUSH UNIVERSITY
Rush University/Rush 
University Medical 
Center has an integrated 
model of clinical, teaching, and research service that 
starts with a shared academic / clinical leadership 
model, and extends down to the faculty.  Indeed, the 
College of Nursing mission statement states, “The 
unification of education, research, and practice is 
the learning model of this college…faculty have 
the opportunity to function in one of three roles: 
teacher-practitioner, teacher-researcher, or researcher-
practitioner”. From a leadership perspective, there 
is cross pollination across the academic and clinical 
organizations, with the Dean of the College of Nursing 
acting as a Vice President of the Medical Center and 
the Chief Nursing Officer acting as an Associate 
Dean in the school of nursing. The College of Nursing 
faculty all operate within a “teacher-practitioner 
model”, participating in and leading multiple aspects 
of the College and Medical Center’s missions.  

Today, the unit-based teacher-practitioner role is 
typically a 0.5 FTE appointment in the medical 
center and a 0.5 FTE appointment in the College 
of Nursing. In this role, the teacher-practitioner has 
teaching responsibilities in coursework and clinical 
experiences for nursing students in the College while 
having a significant service-based role in the medical 
center. Clinical responsibilities include consultation, 
patient care, nursing education, quality improvement, 
and project support.  As an example, an Assistant 
Professor in the College of Nursing serves as the 
Director of the Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse 
Practitioner (ACNP) and Acute Care Clinical Nurse 

22

Specialist Program. She is a certified ACNP and 
works in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU), and 
serves as a lead NP over the NPs working in the CICU. 
Recently, she completed a research study evaluating 
a new model of care in which ACNPs manage 7 CICU 
beds providing 24/7 patient coverage. The expansion 
of these CICU beds addressed the increased volume 
of patients with cardiac diagnoses from the emergency 
department who needed acute, intensive care beds. 
She also spearheaded the development of an NP led 
Heart Failure Admission Reduction Program (HARP). 
In this program the CICU NPs followed patients 
discharged from the CICU for 30 days in collaboration 
with a home health agency. In a 3 month pilot study, 
the HARP patients had an 11% readmission rate 
compared to a 66% readmission rate for heart failure 
patients discharged from the CCIU who did not enroll 
in HARP.

4. Expand clinical integration with joint 
appointments and practice integration. 
Nursing clinical faculty need to maintain 
certification and a priority should be for the 
health system to provide clinical settings, both 
inpatient and outpatient, and compensation 
models that permit them to do so. Joint 
appointments – such as with a clinician-educator 
track or equivalent – also will be important 
to create more points of linkage. Further, the 
integration of nursing faculty into internal 
medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics 
practices will expand capacity and create 
new opportunity for team-based practice and 
potentially research and educational synergy.
5. Promote and expand nurse-managed 
health clinics. Nurse-managed clinics have the 
potential to increase the primary care workforce 
nationallyix and thereby provide an approach 
that AHCs can utilize to strengthen their primary 
care foundations. As AHCs become focused 
on a population-health model designed to 
meet the needs of multiple beneficiary cohorts 
(notably Medicaid), the ability to expand up 
nurse-managed clinics will provide them with 
a complementary and more rapid approach 
to meet these burgeoning needs for access. 

Nurse-managed clinics also can provide needed 
settings for the placement of nursing students 
and the opportunity to gain required outpatient 
services exposure. One dean of nursing indicated 
interest in establishing a nurse-managed clinic 
in the physician outpatient building after-hours 
and on weekends. However, the concept was 
derailed by a lack of consensus as to how the 
nurse-managed clinic would fit with the center’s 
other primary care clinics. During multiple 
interviews we also perceived the strong bias 
toward “physician leaders of the team,” which 
mitigates pushing the envelope on nursing-led 
primary care. About 51% of respondents in the 
survey of nursing deans reported having nurse-
managed clinics managed by their schools of 
nursing, though many clarified in free-responses 
that the clinics were small in scale and in some 
cases were limited to narrow populations such as 
employees/students.x

UNIVERSITY OF 
VIRGINIA
The University of 
Virginia has developed a 
joint appointment model to support collaboration 
and integration between the full-time faculty of 
the school of nursing and the clinical practice. 
One faculty member serves as the Associate 
Dean for Strategic Partnerships & Innovation 
and holds a joint appointment (supported 20% 
financially) with the health system. In that capacity, 
the Associate Dean works with the palliative care 
service, and assists clinicians and students to 
foster quality patient care, education and research. 
Many of these joint appointments —some funded, 
others volunteer—at UVA have been a critical 
element of their collaborative model.

UNIVERSITY OF 
COLORADO
The University of 
Colorado College of 
Nursing launched a nurse-managed and 100% 
nurse-staffed clinic, “Healthcare Partners at 
Bellview” operated out of the College. The clinic 
will provide mostly preventive and primary care 
services as well as basic laboratory services 
and some in-office procedures. The Clinic takes 
insurance, but also charges a monthly flat fee for 
access to all services with no additional co-pays or 
cost-sharing requirements for patients.

6. Expand participation of academic nursing 
in next-generation payment arrangements. In 
those institutions where there is willingness by 
both the health system and the school of nursing 
to collaboratively advance with population-
health innovation, we recommend exploring 
shared efforts to achieve clinical and financial 
results. These efforts may include the health 
system contracting with the school to provide 
care coordination services; have the school’s 
faculty participate as clinical leaders in ACO 
efforts; participation in shared savings efforts; 
collaboration on staffing the ACO’s primary care 
with clinics with APRNS; and direct contracting 
with nursing faculty for the provision of services.

RECOMMENDATION 3: PARTNER IN 
PREPARING THE NURSES OF THE FUTURE
One of the most critical challenges facing AHCs is 
the development of the leadership of the future— 
both the leadership of health science schools within 
universities and the leadership of clinical systems. 
Indeed, one of the core recommendations from the 
IOM Future of Nursing report focused on leadership 
development. According to the survey of university 
presidents, “expanding leadership development to 
train and support future nurse leaders” ranked second 
in terms of priority for schools of nursing in terms of 
opportunities to support the evolution of AHCs.

The time to begin planning is now, and given the 
transformation of AHCs and their partner universities 

23

and health science schools to prosper in healthcare 
reform, new profiles of leaders are emerging that 
academic nursing and AHCs must consider. 

Strategies to consider include:

1. Develop a long-term workforce plan that 
leverages redesigned academic nursing 
educational programs combined with re-
training to prepare nurses for the future.  
In a reconfigured system of health care organized 
around whole-person care, nurses will have 
a critical role as “boundary spanners” linking 
patients with disparate parts of the health system 
and coordinating transitions of care. Academic 
nursing must rapidly adapt their curricula and work 
closely with their affiliated health systems to train 
the next generation of nurses adept at population 
health management, especially for the chronically 
ill, encompassing a myriad of new skills including 
patient coaching, informatics, care transitions, and 
geriatric case management.xi There also is the need 
to provide continuous re-training for the existing 
nursing workforce in these new techniques.

2. AHCs and academic nursing should 
collaborate to develop both a pipeline of new 
nurses at multiple levels (BSN, MSN, PhD, DNP) 
to meet current and future workforce needs, as 
well as programs that advance selected high-
performing nurses to higher levels of education 
and specialized training to further meet internal 
workforce needs in a more cost-effective 
way. Health systems and academic nursing 
must jointly recognize the need for graduate 
preceptorships and collaborate to provide 
the programmatic incentives needed for their 
expansion.xii The Graduate Nursing Education 
(GNE) Demonstration—a Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services (CMS) program that tests 
providing reimbursement to a select number of 
hospitals for the reasonable cost of providing 
clinical training to APRN students—should be 
built upon as a model for collaboration between 
AHCs, academic nursing, and community-based 
training sites in supporting the training of APRNs, 
specifically in community settings.xiii

24

ELMS COLLEGE
Elms College has 
developed an innovative 
academic-practice 
partnership with two separate health systems in 
Massachusetts (Berkshire Health Systems and 
Baystate Health) to prepare APRNs to assist in 
meeting their future workforce needs, specifically 
in the acute care adult setting and in primary 
care. Formalized by agreement, the partnerships 
include a discounted tuition package from the 
College for each cohort that the health systems 
sponsor; collaboration in the selection of qualified, 
high-performing nurses for the organizational 
funded DNP scholarships; provision of clinical 
preceptors and clinical practice sites; joint faculty 
appointments; support of scholarly DNP capstone 
projects to contribute to advancing the systems’ 
goals for quality practice and healthcare delivery; 
and evaluation of student and program outcomes 
including the program model’s impact on the time 
and resources related to transition and orientation 
into practice of the new DNP graduate.  

Eight (8) RNs from each organization (total of 16 
funded students) received full scholarships in 2014 
(first cohort) and in 2015 (second cohort). The 
Elms DNP APRN program is also open to non-
organizationally funded students within the region.

3. Create nursing leadership development 
programs for faculty and clinical practice 
nurses that are jointly managed by the school 
of nursing and clinical practice. Identifying, 
mentoring, and supporting promising nurses for 
leadership positions—both within the faculty 
and nursing clinical practice—but also within the 
broader university and AHC leadership—is critical 
for academic and clinical leaders. The leaders of 
AHCs and health science schools of the future will 
require new profiles—profiles of deans, faculty 
leaders, clinical leaders, and AHC administrative 
leaders that speak to the complexity of evolving 
AHCs. Academic nursing and AHCs must act now to 
start developing the next generation of leadership.

4. Lead the development of interprofessional 
education efforts institution-wide. We found 
near universal agreement that the future of 
healthcare education is interprofessional 
and, according to the survey conducted of 
deans of nursing, 80% of deans report that 
interprofessional education programs are in 
place at their institutions. We found in direct 
discussions, however, few clear examples of a real 
and meaningful approach to interprofessional 
education (both in didactic education and clinical 
training) at most institutions. Many organizations 
are in the early phases of establishing programs 
in this regard that cut across the different 
health sciences schools within an AHC including 
University of Colorado and the University of 
Rochester as well as others, but much work is to 
be done to realize their full potential. Academic 
nursing should take the lead in driving 
interprofessional education development in 
partnership with university presidents and their 
health science college dean counterparts.

UNIVERSITY OF 
COLORADO
The University of 
Colorado has developed 
a medical-campus specific interprofessional 
education program. The current Interprofessional 
Education Program is overseen by the IPE Council. 
Representation on the council comes from each 
of the schools/colleges. The representative, an 
Assistant Director for Interprofessional Education, 
serves as an advisor, consultant and collaborator 
within the IPE council. The council oversees 
the IPE program across campus. The students 
participate in two eight-week courses, using team-
based learning. 

There are three components of the program: 

 ▪ The Interprofessional Education and 

Development (IPED) Course focuses on team 
dynamics and communication which are 
shared across all AHC-affiliated schools and 
programs.

 ▪ Clinical Transformations (CT) Simulations, 

which provides an opportunity for students 
to work together in a simulated environment 
focused on teamwork and communication. 

 ▪ Clinical Integrations (CI), which allows 
students to practice interprofessional 
health care in clinical situations. The Dawn 
Clinic is an interprofessional clinic serving 
underserved and uninsured clients within the 
local community. 

The IPE program essentially sits with the 
Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs. There is a 
Coordinating Council composed of the Deans 
and the Vice Chancellor who review and provide 
support for the IPE. program.

UNIVERSITY OF 
ROCHESTER 
The University of 
Rochester Medical 
Center Institute for Innovative Education (IIE) 
was created to identify and facilitate common 
medical center educational priorities and to 
support and promote interprofessional education 
initiatives. The institute has a dedicated board 
that includes the Dean of Nursing, and is currently 
developing a URMC-wide educational strategic 
plan that will emphasize inter-professional tram 
training. After the plan is adopted, the IIE will 
develop and drive specific educational initiatives 
for the medical center as well as its community 
clinicians. The Board and the institute are also 
acting as a vehicle to seek out and apply for 
funding to support programs and initiatives within 
the interprofessional education space. The IIE 
has supported the successful application of an 
Assistant Dean for Interprofessional Education 
for a Macy’s Faculty Scholar grant. This grant has 
allowed URMC to study the impact of the use of 
the electronic medical record on patient/family 
centered care and communication and to develop 
ways to enhance these processes. The IIE has 
also supported the third annual Collaborative 

25

Care Symposium bringing nationally recognized 
experts to URMC to discuss issues related to 
collaborative practice and interprofessional 
education and team training.

RECOMMENDATION 4:  
PARTNER IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
ACCOUNTABLE CARE
Most AHCs are seeking to form systems of care and 
prepare for accountable care. Some are seeking to 
be leaders in this regard. The early experience of 
AHCs with accountable care programs including 
the Physician Group Practice demonstration and 
the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and 
Pioneer ACOs indicates several defining success 
factors, including having a primary care foundation, 
experience with risk-bearing products, building close 
relationships with post-acute and long-term care, 
significant data and analytics expertise, and patient 
and community engagement.xiv According to a 2015 
article in Nursing Outlook, 18 of 32 original Pioneer 
ACOs were developing new and enhanced roles for 
registered nurses across the continuum of care, with 
many enhancing roles for RNs in the various clinical 
activities of the ACO.xv

Medicaid programs nationally are undergoing 
significant transformation as well, as states respond 
to significant budgetary issues, Medicaid program 
growth (now the single biggest payer nationally), and a 
need to re-orient services for an increasingly complex 
population. AHCs in many markets care for high 
numbers of Medicaid beneficiaries and in some states 
are sole-providers of complex care services. As a 
result, AHCs often care for significantly more complex 
patients who fall through the cracks of a fragmented 
delivery system and who may require significantly 
higher levels of care.

As a result of the Medicaid imperative for a population 
health model, AHCs increasingly are developing 
networks of services in the community, moving off 
campus and out of the hospital to meet patients in 
their neighborhoods with new kinds of services. 
Nurses, including academic nursing clinical faculty, 
are vital contributors to developing these types 

26

of community-health programs and community-
engagement models, extending to primary care and 
nurse-managed clinics.

Strategies that academic nursing and AHC 
leadership should consider in adopting this 
recommendation include:

1. Engage in joint clinical planning as part of a 
larger, integrated strategic planning process 
that incorporates all academic and clinical 
entities. Many of the organizations identified 
with stronger partnership between academic 
nursing and the health system began with a 
more integrated strategic planning process that 
incorporated school of nursing leaders in clinical 
system planning and vice versa. In particular, 
academic nursing has contributed to the long-
term planning for new population health models 
of care, including linking to evolving clinical 
training programs both within schools of nursing 
and, more broadly, across health science schools.

THE UNIVERSITY  
OF FLORIDA
University of Florida 
Health has established 
a unified strategic plan that brought together 
all of the clinical and academic units within 
the academic health center. UF Health, which 
encompasses several hospitals and physician 
practices, the health professional colleges and 
numerous research institutes, is now operating 
within one strategic framework and set of 
organizational goals around its three missions 
that can only be achieved through functional 
integration and collaboration.
In keeping with national recommendations to 
improve nursing practice and help nurses become 
well-positioned to lead change and advance 
health, the College of Nursing and the UF Health 
Shands Hospital division of nursing began to 
strategically collaborate in education, research, 
and patient care. As part of this partnership, 
both Anna McDaniel, PhD, RN, FAAN, dean of 

the UF College of Nursing, and Irene Alexaitis, 
DNP, RN, NEA-BC, chief nursing officer and vice 
president for nursing and patient services at UF 
Health Shands Hospital, now hold positions and 
active roles within the hospital system and college, 
respectively. In addition to serving as dean, Dr. 
McDaniel serves as the UF Health assistant vice 
president for academic-practice partnerships, 
and Dr. Alexaitis serves as the College of Nursing 
associate dean for academic-practice partnerships. 
As part of a stronger partnership, several new 
initiatives emerged. The Academic Partnership 
Unit, or APU, is a new model of clinical education 
that places nursing students in units to shadow and 
learn from staff nurses who hold courtesy faculty 
appointments. The program, which started in fall 
2014, is a joint effort between leaders in the UF 
College of Nursing and UF Health Shands Nursing 
to enhance education and integration between 
students and nursing staff. The APU model ensures 
a low faculty-to-student ratio — two students per 
faculty member — and allows for more two-way 
dialogue and interaction and a hands-on patient 
care experience. 
In 2015, the College established a RN-to-BSN 
program exclusively for UF Health registered nurses 
to obtain their bachelor’s degree online from UF, 
thus helping the hospital system reach the strategic 
goal of increasing its pool of BSN-educated 
nurses. This successful program recently has been 
expanded for nurses across the state of Florida.

2. Play a leadership role in developing 
linkages between acute care and post-acute, 
home-based, and long-term care services. 
Accountable care approaches are emphasizing 
transitions in care to reduce hospital readmissions 
and because transitions are often where patients 
can “fall through the cracks.” Academic nursing 
can play an important role in the development of 
and training around next-generation care models, 
developing communication and care protocols 
that extend care team continuity across settings of 
care, and focusing on nursing excellence in non-
acute settings.

3. Expand nurse-led community programs 
under the leadership of academic nursing 
faculty in partnership with health system 
leaders and clinicians. Developing a community 
presence and set of services for specific 
populations is a key imperative for AHCs. In 
addition to providing healthcare services closer 
to home through a new network of community 
practices, AHCs are seeking to develop an 
approach to connect to community-based and 
social resources to support prevention and 
non-medical needs of patients. Further, nursing 
students at multiple levels are playing an essential 
role in prevention and community wellness 
outreach efforts, which could be linked more 
formally to AHC population health strategies. 
Academic nursing—both through direct provision 
of services and through research programs on 
these topics—can be strong partners to AHCs.

UNIVERSITY  
OF TEXAS  
HEALTH SCIENCE 
CENTER,  
SAN ANTONIO
UTHSCSA faculty developed a nursing faculty 
practice plan, the Nursing Services Research & 
Development Plan (NSRDP) approved by the 
Board of Regents, led by the Vice Dean for 
Practice and Engagement that is a separate and 
distinct clinical practice entity from the Schools of 
Medicine and Dentistry. The plan represents all 
faculty that are 50% time or more. The practice 
plan purchases certain MSO services from the 
School of Medicine (specifically billing support). 
The plan focuses strongly on providing care for 
the underserved, recently being recognized by 
the city for its efforts in support of the UTHSCSA 
employee health and wellness clinic.  The plan 
runs several different clinics in partnership with 
community agencies, as well as a student health 
center, and the UTHSCSA employee health 
clinic. In addition to billing for services, the plan 
has been successful at securing other sources 
of funding such as foundations and community-
based projects focused on Medicaid beneficiaries.

27

4. Advance innovative evidence-based care 
models and interventions focused on improving 
the health status of underserved members 
of the community linked to an overall AHC 
clinical strategy. Faculty research programs 
around community health, social determinants 
of health, population, and public health should 
be supported and tested in the ever-expanding 
network of community clinics, particularly in 
communities that are typically underserved. 
As AHCs seek to take leadership positions 
within state-wide Medicaid reform, a need for 
innovative approaches to community-based 
care for the underserved with a focus that 
moves beyond medical needs will be needed. 
Academic nursing faculty can be vital partners in 
developing and executing a strategy to meet the 
needs of communities.
5. Encourage leadership roles for academic 
nursing faculty and leaders outside the AHC in 
the community. Academic nursing leaders and 
nurses more generally should seek to expand 
their role as community leaders, seeking key 
board positions and partners with community 
organizations that can help to raise their profile, 
and the visibility of the work that they do.

RECOMMENDATION 5:  
INVEST IN NURSING RESEARCH 
PROGRAMS AND BETTER INTEGRATE 
RESEARCH INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE
One CNO commented: “When you work in an 
academic environment, you need to elevate 
the practice of nursing through that academic 
connectivity—through cutting edge research—and 
make it part of the daily life and practice of the nursing 
clinical practice.” Echoing this comment, a university 
president said “any dean is more credible if they hire 
and mentor faculty who are successful in securing NIH 
funding.” Indeed, research should be a foundational and 
vibrant dimension of academic nursing and of the nursing 
clinical practice of the academic health system.

Yet academic nursing does not hold the same stature 
as other health professional schools in terms of 
large, resource-rich research programs. As indicated 
previously, overall NIH funding is miniscule compared 

28

to other health professional schools, and other sources 
of research funding fail to provide adequate support. 
This despite the reality that nurse-scientist-led 
research is steeped in patient-oriented research and 
research focused on improvements in quality, safety, 
outcomes, and patient engagement—the types of 
research critical to the pressing need to transform care 
delivery nationally. University presidents in the survey 
conducted for this report indicated this as the number 
one priority in their view for academic nursing.

In addition to overall limited resources, there 
often exist poor linkages between academic nurse 
investigators and their research programs, and those 
being led by hospital or health system-based nurses 
in the AHC. Nursing units led by hospital-employed 
nurses also conduct research projects, far too often 
with little linkages to academic nursing faculty. 
Institutional barriers are often to blame for these silos 
– through the lack of joint appointments for nurse-
researchers and regulatory barriers that prevent faculty 
from utilizing health system resources for conducting 
research and vice versa. A true, research-grounded 
and evidence-based nursing service that contributes 
to the overall academic mission of the AHC, the 
advancement of knowledge, and improvements in the 
health and lives of patients is critical.

Strategies to consider include: 

1. Create mechanisms to coordinate research 
projects and activities across academic nursing 
and the AHC with a shared leadership structure 
and resources. For those schools of nursing 
that have extensive research aspirations, closer 
ties to their affiliated medical school and health 
system will be mutually beneficial. Organizational 
integration may be realized by linking deans 
of research; research and/or program councils; 
and by involving nurse scientists in developing 
clinical research initiatives. We recommend a 
process be established to support broader access 
by nurse scientists to core services within the 
medical school and across the university- such 
as data sets, informatics, and clinical research 
infrastructure. Where not already in place, joint 
IRB or coordinated IRBs should be put into place.

2. Develop joint research programs between 
academic nursing and health system nurse-
scientists. Many clinical research projects will 
benefit from teams of faculty and clinical practice 
nurses working collaboratively in and out of 
nursing units. Jointly submitted grants should 
be considered, and academic nursing and AHCs 
should work to limit administrative and regulatory 
barriers to collaboration across entities.
3. Integrate nurse researchers into developing 
informatics programs. Vast investment by 
medical schools and health systems is flowing into 
developing informatics programs, many of which 
emphasize clinical informatics. As these programs 
are planned, organized, and resourced, they 
should incorporate the perspectives and talents of 
academic nursing. Nurses trained as informaticians 
will be invaluable complements to developing an 
informatics initiative, extending to the development 
of graduate training programs and other resources. 
Achieving meaningful results with “big data” will 
require nursing involvement to overcome, including 

establishing standard data definitions, patient 
engagement applications, decision support, and 
security, to name just a few.xvi
4. Strengthen clinical research nursing. The 
continuing growth of clinical research, combined 
with emphasis on T1 through T4 translational 
research, requires an ever larger and more adept 
cohort of nurse clinical trial coordinators and 
clinical research nurses, a specialized and valued 
position. The emphasis on patient assessment 
and coordination, clinical observation, “deep” 
phenotyping, and broader patient engagement 
requirements make nursing involvement more and 
more critical. Despite this impetus, the field of 
clinical research nursing remains undeveloped, and 
there is a need for more detailed role definition 
combined with enhanced training by academic 
nursing combined with career progression and 
opportunities with affiliated health systems and 
schools of medicine. 

29

5. Lead in the establishment of linkages to 
other schools for multi-disciplinary research 
programs and approaches. The convergence 
of disciplines in the conduct of biomedical and 
health services research will continue at a rapid 
pace. Academic nursing should help lead the 
development of transdisciplinary research projects 
in partnership with schools of medicine, pharmacy, 
dentistry, public health, allied health, and non-
health science schools as well.

THE UNIVERSITY  
OF FLORIDA
University of Florida is 
seeking to enhance the 
research profile of its College of Nursing as part of 
UF’s preeminence initiative. UF Preeminence is the 
university’s effort to become a national and international 
leader in more than two dozen areas, including health 
care and the sciences, fueled by an investment from 
the Florida legislature. Through this initiative, two 
preeminent nurse researchers are now at UF and will 
enhance the UF College of Nursing and UF Health 
Shands shared research agenda, especially in nursing 
informatics and palliative care.

The College of Nursing and UF Health Shands also have 
developed a director of clinical research role to foster 
integration between the nurse faculty-led research 
programs and those of the hospital system. This director 
serves as a bridge between faculty members at the 
college and nurses in the hospital to facilitate research 
and assists the nurses at UF Health Shands hospitals with 
formulating clinical research projects. 

Among success stories are collaborations between 
expert faculty at the college and key clinical care teams 
at the hospitals, including efforts focused on bone 
marrow transplant, sickle cell, and wound ostomy. These 
collaborations include Doctor of Nursing Practice 
students actively working with clinical units at the 
hospitals as part of their final projects and clinical faculty 
members providing expertise to both the hospital staff 
and researchers.

The College of Nursing had a large and active presence 
at UF Health Shands Nursing Research Day. In addition, 
a robust Journal Club brings faculty members and 
clinical nurses together to discuss clinical issues, which 
promotes evidence-based practice and research.

THE UNIVERSITY  
OF PENNSYLVANIA
Penn Medicine has 
established and fully funded 
a Director of Nursing Research and Science position 
tasked with providing leadership for the development 
of nursing research within the Hospital of the University 
of Pennsylvania, the primary academic hospital of Penn 
Medicine. This position reports directly to the CNO. The 
Director chairs a Shared Governance Research Core 
Council and is charged with  advancing a culture of 
scholarship and inquiry as well as developing strategies 
specifically to integrate with the school of nursing.

6. Expand nursing faculty development and 
recruitment to include PhD investigators across 
multiple disciplines in targeted research areas. 
The aspirations for nurse-scientist research, which 
can underpin many of the promised innovations 
from population health, will never be realized 
without a significant increment in the number 
of nurse PhDs. The traditional route for nurse-
scientists which includes multiple decades in 
clinical practice results in nurses receiving their 
doctorates at a median age of 47, resulting 
in a research work-force with far more limited 
time to build scientific programs.xviii There is a 
rapidly developing shortage of clinically trained 
investigators—including veterinarian-scientists, 
dentist-scientists, and nurse-scientists—to carry 
out the next generation of clinically focused 
research and to develop the next generation of 
clinician scientists.xix Given the shortage of nurse-
scientists, academic nursing should expand faster-
track training programs for nurses interested in a 
science career, particularly if successful advocacy 
can increase the NINR budget and therefore funds 
available for graduate training support. However, 
research conducted by schools of nursing need not 
be confined to nurse-scientists alone. 
Today, academic nursing faculty rosters heavily 
favor faculty with PhDs in nursing and those with a 
clinical certification due to state and accreditation 
requirements for faculty. Specifically, AACN data 
shows that of the 50% of nursing faculty with 
doctoral degrees, 10.7% of full-time faculty have 

non-nursing doctoral degrees. In order to expand 
their research capacity, schools of nursing should 
consider recruiting faculty with masters’ degrees 
and PhDs in other disciplines such as informatics, 
clinical and translational research, biology, public 
health, epidemiology, and other related fields. This 
recruitment should be considered in coordination 
and partnership with their affiliated AHC and health 
professional schools (including public health).

RECOMMENDATION 6: IMPLEMENT AN  
ADVOCACY AGENDA IN SUPPORT OF A 
NEW ERA FOR ACADEMIC NURSING
Critical to the success of many of the recommendations 
and strategies in this report, as well as to the elevation 
of the profession more generally as “true full partners 
with physicians and other health professionals in 
redesigning health care in the United States,” are 
significant changes to various policies at the state and 
federal levels. Issues related to nursing’s role in care 
delivery have been at the top of the agenda; however, 
there are several other areas specifically related to 
academic nursing and to academic nursing’s role in 
healthcare transformation that should be considered.

Strategies to consider include:

1. Seek growth in the NINR budget to support 
nursing-led research projects and nurse-
scientist training. The NINR budget represents 
less than 1% of the total NIH budget, yet supports 
nurse-led research in key transformation areas 
that has the potential to transform patient care, 
including with respect to patient outcomes. The 
NINR is also a leading sponsor for nurse-scientist 
training through the Graduate Partnership 
Program and also a variety of extra-mural awards.
2. Support the recommendations made to the 
NIH director for increased support for clinician-
scientists and initiate a dialogue to define how 
to increase the numbers of nurse-scientists in the 
future clinician-scientist workforce.
3. Develop a coalition of stakeholders to 
advocate for increased public funding to 
support a national nursing agenda that 
links to the Triple Aim. This should include 
advocacy for increased funding targeted toward 

RUSH UNIVERSITY
In 2007, the Center for 
Clinical Research and 
Scholarship was formed at 
Rush University Medical Center to serve as a formal 
mechanism to help further advance research and 
evidence based projects. Two teacher-practitioners 
serve to mentor clinical staff to develop formal 
research proposals. Pilot funding is available for 
clinical teams to propose research ideas. Teams are 
formed to join clinical staff with a faculty mentor for 
the project along with a graduate nursing student to 
facilitate their exposure to the research process. Over 
50 clinical projects have been facilitated under the 
direction and assistance of the teacher practitioners 
including quality improvement projects, education-
based projects, pilot study initiatives and research 
studies. The Center also sponsors clinical grand 
rounds with internal and invited researchers, applies 
for and obtains research funding for clinical projects, 
provides mentorship for abstract and manuscript 
preparation, and facilitates a journal recycling 
initiative for faculty to donate their monthly journal 
issues that has resulted in distribution of over 1000 
clinical and research journal issues to the clinical units 
to promote dissemination of research and evidence-
based practice resources for clinical staff. 

UNIVERSITY OF 
CALIFORNIA,  
SAN FRANCISCO
University of California, 
San Francisco (UCSF) facilitates transdisciplinary 
research approaches across its health science 
schools. The school of nursing looks to include 
relevant school of medicine faculty in faculty 
and leadership search committees and where 
appropriate contribute to percent efforts to facilitate 
collaborations for the new hire. Further, UCSF has 
in place other mechanisms to integrate research 
programs. At UCSF, faculty conducting research 
collaborate easily across departments and schools 
based on research resonance. School of nursing 

31

faculty investigators have faculty from other 
professional schools and the other schools have 
school of nursing faculty on their grants as co-
investigators. This is a longstanding relationship 
that reflects the definition of UCSF as a research 
intensive institution.

transdisciplinary research questions and projects 
around key health issues ranging from basic 
science to the population science. Advocacy 
should also extend to the realm of education, 
including expansion of the current GNE 
Demonstration and enhanced federal support for 
graduate training of nurses in critical areas, similar 
to that of support for medical GME funding.
4. Continue to advocate for scope of practice 
changes to enable nurses to take on the clinical 
roles they are trained to perform and support 
academic nursing leadership in clinical care 
delivery. Academic nursing should contribute to 
the conversation related to restrictions on scope 
of practice. As AHCs increasingly look to academic 
nursing and its faculty for clinical innovation, having 
the ability to easily translate these advances into 
clinical practice will require nurses to function at 
the top of their license and education. Indeed, the 
AACN Futures Task Force recently recommended 
that AACN position nursing as a leading partner 
in advancing systemic improvements in health 
and health care.xx Additional advocacy is required 
to accompany scope of practice changes with 
changes in reimbursement for APRNs so that 
reimbursement and practice align.
5. Position AACN, a leading advocate in 
partnership with other organizations, to 
communicate the importance of nursing-
led research programs to federal, state, and 
private funders. The AACN Futures Task Force 
also recommended that AACN be a leader 
in information curation and synthesis related 
to nursing education, research, and practice. 
AACN should fill a critical void in the national 
conversation on funding for nurse-led research.

Collectively, these recommendations advance the 
shared missions of AHCs and academic nursing in 
significant, tangible, and beneficial ways. During 
the development of these recommendations and 
this report, the Institute of Medicine released 
an update on their 2010 Future of Nursing 
Report that indeed confirms the importance 
and timeliness of the recommendations in our 
report. The update, Assessing Progress on the 
IOM Report—The Future of Nursingxxi, provides 
an updated set of 10 recommendations to the 
healthcare community within the spirit of the 
original report. The recommendations contained 
in the report further push for an enhanced role 
for nursing in the redesign of care delivery 
and payment systems, a commitment to the 
development of nurses to advanced practice, 
and for a renewed focus on interprofessional 
education and clinical practice models. Our 
recommendations fit squarely within the spirit of 
both the original IOM report and this important 
update, and our hope is that as AHC leaders 
consider implementing our own series of specific 
academic nursing alignment recommendations in 
their own organizations, the promise of the IOM 
report will be more fully realized.

Implementation 
Strategies

Achieving the potential for academic nursing as 
described in this report requires a change in culture 
that can only be accomplished by the collaborative 
leadership of university presidents, deans of nursing 
and medicine, and health system chief executives. 
All parties must embrace a new vision for academic 
nursing, and by doing so deal directly with the cultural 
and structural issues that are impeding the flowering of 
potential that indeed all perceive.

Leaders committed to a new vision for academic 
nursing will challenge the status quo and seek to 
unharness the potential of their nursing colleagues. 
Participatory governance structures that cross-
populate, as appropriate, leaders of the academic and 

32

clinical practices will help to ensure mission integration 
and proper insights from a diverse set of constituencies. 
In particular, nursing representation on AHC boards 
can bring forth expertise in magnet certification, 
wellness initiatives, patient safety initiations, EHR 
adoption, trauma certification, workforce development, 
APRN deployment, patient education initiatives, 
and evidence-based clinical decision-making. In 
addition, nurses typically represent the lion’s share of 
healthcare organization budgets, provide the majority 
of in-patient care, and train the clinical workforce in 
schools of nursing. Participatory governance will be 

enhanced immeasurably by collaborative strategic 
and financial decision-making around academic and 
clinical programs, workforce development, and research 
programs. Further alignment of medicine, nursing, and 
health system organizations may also prove beneficial 
for certain institutions.

The following recommendations for deans of nursing, 
deans of medicine, health system executives, and 
university presidents/chancellors are intended to 
help leaders in AHCs achieve the potential from an 
enhanced role for academic nursing in the continuing 
evolution of their institutions.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEANS  
OF NURSING
The challenge—and opportunity—for academic 
nursing and its leadership rests primarily in preparing 
for an enhanced role in clinical service delivery and 
a renewed focus on growth in size and stature of 
research programs. It is, as many of the deans of 
nursing interviewed for this project indicated, a 
“paradigm shift” for academic nursing leaders in 
developing the right mix of faculty, and the right 
partnerships with health system and academic 
medicine leaders so as to become full partners in the 
health enterprise. Deans of nursing must develop the 
business case for a new partnership model with AHCs, 

 ▪ Growing clinical faculty in School of Nursing 

that maintain practice within the health 
system

 ▪ Joint stategic planning
 ▪ Financial support model to facilitate School 

of Nursing investment

 ▪ Growth and integration of research 

programs into clinical practice

one that demonstrates clearly the benefits academic 
nursing can bring to the complex environment of 
academic clinical care delivery and make the case for 
the resources and investment needed. 

The following strategies will begin to help deans of 
nursing push their organizations forward: 

1 Enhance clinical practice opportunities for 

clinically focused faculty to ensure that a robust 
clinical faculty exists to carry out the teaching 
mission of the school in the health system, and tie 
important clinical advances and innovations back into 
the academic environment in the school of nursing.

33

2 Engage health system CNO/CEO to create 

clinical leadership/administrative/practice roles 
for select school of nursing faculty through 
shared appointments and other means, including 
potentially jointly funded positions charged with 
facilitating alignment and integration of the academic 
and clinical missions.

3 Propose a nursing enterprise workforce 

development program to help mitigate health 
system shortages for nurses prepared at all 

levels, developing promising nurses for leadership 
roles and enhanced education opportunities, and 
developing the faculty of the future to lead academic 
nursing and the academic mission.

4 Establish a strategic agenda for research 

incorporating themes of relevance to the region 
such as chronic illness management. Expand the 
academic nursing faculty roster to include both nursing 
and non-nursing PhD investigators in critical research 
areas that are funded and can help grow the portfolio 
(in size and scope) of research conducted in academic 
nursing. Develop and expand scientific research training 
programs and build a cadre of nurse-scientist faculty.

5 Review promotion and tenure policies for their 

alignment with academic nursing’s achievement 
of the tripartite mission, allowing for faculty to 

maintain strong clinical practices in the health system 
alongside their academic responsibilities

As one indicator of expectations, of various 
characteristics valued in a Dean of Nursing, University 
president respondents rated “ability to partner with 
the Dean of Medicine” as the highest.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEANS  
OF MEDICINE
Deans of medicine have long benefited from close 
alignment and in most cases fairly full integration 
with their partner AHCs. Deans of medicine have 
maintained key leadership positions both from a 
governance and management perspective in AHCs, 
and leading faculty (department chairs, division chiefs, 
etc.) typically run the various clinical departments in 
the hospital, with further responsibility for growing 
AHC service lines a new theme and responsibility. This 
alignment gives added stature and weight when it 

34

comes to AHC and university decision-making. There 
are several areas where the leadership of deans of 
medicine is critical to advancing many of the interests 
discussed in this report. Ultimately, the success of 
schools of medicine is contingent upon a robust, high-
performing clinical partner and school of medicine 
leadership should be keenly aware of opportunities 
to advance them. This leadership also can extend to 
academic nursing to achieve a level of alignment and 
integration that benefits the entirety of the academic 
and clinical enterprises. Given the scale of academic 
medicine in the overall financial portrait of universities, 
academic medicine and its leadership carry significant 
weight and can champion approaches to alignment 
with schools of nursing. 

The following strategies will begin to help deans of 
medicine achieve this potential: 

and academic medicine research and increase 
interprofessional research programs and funding 

through leadership of the dean’s office and in some 
cases through shared investment in key areas.

1 Facilitate linkages between academic nursing

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HEALTH 
SYSTEMS EXECUTIVES
AHC CEOs and CNOs are critical to the adoption 
and ultimate success of this strategic framework and 
its recommendations. They run and are responsible 
for the entirety of the clinical nursing services and 
the broader AHC enterprise, and they have needs 
and challenges with which nursing (academic nursing 
in particular) may help meet and solve. CEOs and 
CNOs can facilitate the development of the right 
organizational mechanisms to link academic nursing 
faculty and leaders into the operations of the health 
system in a way that allows them to contribute to 
innovative solutions. 

The following strategies will begin to help CEOs and 
CNOs realize a new partnership model with academic 
nursing: 

1 Establish participation for academic nursing 

on governing bodies and within health system 
leadership through appointment of school 
of nursing leaders on key governing boards and 
committees.

2 Integrate the school of 

nursing into applied 
programs for clinical 
innovation where possible, 
particularly in areas of patient 
safety, quality, population health 
science, and patient experience, 
with appropriate financial support 
in place to sponsor services

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR UNIVERSITY 
PRESIDENTS, CHANCELLORS, AND VICE 
CHANCELLORS
In both university-based and university-affiliated 
AHCs, presidents/chancellors (and in some cases vice 
chancellors for health affairs) should be engaged in 
support of the alignment between academic nursing 
and AHCs. University leaders can be powerful 
forces in organizing academic leaders in integrated 
strategic planning efforts to ensure optimal utilization 
of resources, and they can organize leaders around 
discreet initiatives with respect to research and 
academic programs. They also can support schools 
of nursing more directly in recruiting deans of 
nursing for the future and in some cases can provide 
needed investment for academic nursing to begin 
transformation efforts contained in this report. Lastly, 
where it makes sense they can create organizational 
alignment by unifying the differing reporting

structures where value can be created.

program development.

The core of this investigation has been to answer the 
question, “How can academic nursing leaders partner 
with AHCs to transform health care?” We propose 
that academic nursing has a significant role to play in 
transforming health care, and indeed is a necessary 
partner for AHCs as they seek to become patient and 
community-centered. 

We believe that the vision and strategic framework for 
action we set forth in this report is transformational, 
and different components will be appealing based 
on institutional context. We recognize that numerous 
factors will impact the ultimate adoption of the 
recommendations contained in this report – existing 
organizational structures and governance models, 
current leadership and cultures between schools of 
nursing and AHCs, financial resources, the clinical 
services market around AHCs, competition, current 

36

pace of change, current academic and clinical strength, 
among many other factors. However, all organizations 
can benefit from a candid assessment of where they are 
today with respect to the recommendations we make in 
this report – and to what extent there are opportunities 
for alignment between schools of nursing and AHCs.

What is clear from our investigation is that success in 
adopting this vision and the elements of the strategic 
framework we set forth is first and foremost, the 
development of a shared vision among all academic 
and clinical leaders. This vision entails commitment to a 
transformative role for academic nursing in the evolving 
academic health system. It requires an approach to 
integration and alignment among schools of nursing 
and their colleagues in all health science schools. And 
we believe this shared vision is essential so as to achieve 
the aspirations described by the IOM in The Future of 
Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health (2010).

We wish to acknowledge the significant barriers to 
moving our recommendations forward. These include 
resistance to change by the leaders of the various 
entities involved, organizations and financial systems 
that encourage siloed approaches to various healthcare 
entities and academic programs, and a lack of conviction 
that the changes we have outlined will be necessary or 
important for transforming an AHC’s clinical delivery 
system. In this regard, it may be necessary to move 
forward incrementally in terms of our recommendations, 
so that the value of each new program can be evaluated 
and appreciated gradually and the leadership of the 
various entities can gain confidence. In some institutions 
a more rapid transformation may be possible, but this 
may not be feasible in many, where a forceful approach 
could potentially backfire.

The authors have designed this report, and the 
accompanying assessment in the Appendix to facilitate 
the process of evaluating the partnership role of 
academic nursing in your organization. The framework 
for action, its associated recommendations, and the 
implementation strategies for deans of nursing, deans 
of medicine, CEOs/CNOs, and university leaders are 
intended to encourage your own thinking about the 
current state of alignment and integration and to 
stimulate initial conversations about approaches you 
can take today to advance discussions regarding the 
future of academic nursing in your institution.

APPENDIX A – ORGANIZATIONAL  
SELF-ASSESSMENT
Overview

A candid assessment of where your organization is 
today with respect to the recommendations contained 
in this report is a critical first step to achieving 
the vision of academic nursing as a full partner in 
healthcare delivery, education, and research integrated 
and funded across all professions and missions in 
academic health systems. This assessment will walk 
through each of the report’s recommendations 
and help you to understand how your organization 
performs today and how important each is in your 
organization to strategically focus on in the near term. 
The recommendations in this report are collectively 
ambitious and will require leaders across nursing, 
medicine, and academic health systems to carefully 
evaluate and prioritize strategic initiatives and develop 
a long-term implementation approach that is tailored 
to each organization’s unique circumstances.

This assessment can be completed by any AHC leader 
including health science school deans, university 
presidents, and health system leadership and can be 
used to compare perspectives of different leaders as a 
starting place for developing a plan to implement the 
recommendations in this report.

Instructions

Please consider the recommendations contained on 
pages 32-52 of the report. For each recommendation 
and sub-recommendation, we ask you to first evaluate:

1. Criticality of Recommendation – How critical is 
this recommendation to me and my organization to 
achieve? Can we succeed long-term without it?

2. Current Organizational Performance – Has 
this recommendation been implemented in my 
organization in any way? If so, to what degree has it 
been implanted? How well have we performed?

We then ask you to provide a score for each of the 
two evaluation criteria that will be used to calculate 
the results of this assessment. Please use the following 
scoring methodology:

1. Criticality of Recommendation – How critical is 
this recommendation to my organization?

●● [5] Very critical to my organization’s success

●● [4] Critical to my organization’s success

●● [3] Somewhat critical to my organization’s success

●● [2] Not very critical to my organization’s success

●● [1] Not critical to my organization’s success at all

2. Current Organizational Performance:

●● Strong

●● Moderate

●● Weak

●● Not Possible/Not Applicable

At the end of the assessment there is a score sheet 
that should be used to tabulate the results of the 
assessment.

WHAT YOUR SCORES MEAN
These scores will help you rank which recommendations 
you should focus on developing and implementing in 
your organizations, and will help academic and clinical 
leadership teams understand where there is agreement 
on major initiatives to pursue with the school of nursing.

The matched pairs of criticality scores and 
organizational performance scores will help you 
develop your strategic approach going forward:

●● A high criticality score matched with a low 

organizational importance score is indicative of a 
recommendation that should be prioritized.

●● A high criticality score matched with a 

high performance score is indicative of a 
recommendation that should be supported 
ongoing, and an area where learnings can be 
shared across the community of academic nursing 
and AHCs.

●● Recommendations with low criticality scores should 

be prioritized last.
